  <p id="pgiii"><strong>PREFACE</strong></p>
  <p>The art of using one's native tongue correctly and forcibly is acquired
    for the most part through imitation and practice, and is not so much a
    matter of knowledge as of habit. As regards English, then, the first duty
    of our schools is to set before pupils excellent models, and, in all
    departments of school-work, to keep a watchful eye on the innumerable acts
    of expression, oral and written, which go to form habit. Since, however,
    pupils come to school with many of their habits of expression already
    formed on bad models, our schools must give some attention to the special
    work of pointing out common errors of speech, and of leading pupils to
    convert knowledge of these errors into new and correct habits of
    expression. This is the branch of English teaching in which this little
    book hopes to be useful.</p>
  <p>All the &quot;Exercises in English&quot; with which I am acquainted consist chiefly
    of &quot;sentences to be corrected.&quot; To such exercises there are grave
    objections. If, on the one hand, the fault in the given sentence is not
    seen at a glance, the pupil is likely, as experience has shown, to pass it
    by and to change something that is not wrong. If, on <span id="pgiv"></span>the other hand, the
    fault is obvious, the exercise has no value in the formation of habit.
    Take, for example, two &quot;sentences for correction&quot; which I select at random
    from one of the most widely used books of its class: &quot;I knew it was him,&quot;
    and &quot;Sit the plates on the table.&quot; A pupil of any wit will at once see
    that the mistakes must be in &quot;him&quot; and &quot;sit,&quot; and knowing that the
    alternatives are &quot;he&quot; and &quot;set,&quot; he will at once correct the sentences
    without knowing, perhaps, why one form is wrong, the other right. He has
    not gained anything valuable; he has simply &quot;slid&quot; through his exercise.
    Moreover, such &quot;sentences for correction&quot; violate a fundamental principle
    of teaching English by setting before the impressionable minds of pupils
    bad models. Finally, such exercises are unnatural, because the habit which
    we hope to form in our pupils is not the habit of correcting mistakes, but
    the habit of avoiding them.</p>
  <p>Correct English is largely a matter of correct choice between two or more
    forms of expression, and in this book an attempt has been made, as a
    glance at the pages will show, to throw the exercises, whenever possible,
    into a form consistent with this truth. Though a pupil may <em>change</em> &quot;who&quot;
    to &quot;whom&quot; without knowing why, he cannot repeatedly <em>choose</em> correctly
    between these forms without strengthening his own habit of correct
    expression.</p>
  <p>This book has been prepared primarily as a companion to Professor A.S.
    Hill's &quot;Foundations of Rhetoric,&quot; in answer to the request of many
    teachers for exercises to <span id="pgv"></span>use with that admirable work.<span id="FNanchor1"></span><a
      href="#Footnote1">[1]</a> Without the
    friendly encouragement of Professor Hill the task would not have been
    undertaken, and to him above all others I am indebted for assistance in
    completing it. He has permitted me to draw freely on his published works;
    he has provided me with advance sheets of the revised edition of
    &quot;Principles of Rhetoric;&quot; he has put at my disposal much useful material
    gleaned from his own experience; he has read the manuscript and proofs,
    and, without assuming any responsibility for shortcomings, he has
    suggested many improvements. I am also indebted to Mr. E.G. Coy,
    Headmaster of the Hotchkiss School, for many valuable suggestions, and to
    my colleague, Mr. J.E. Barss, for assistance in the proof-reading.</p>
  <p>The quotations from &quot;The Century Dictionary&quot; are made under an arrangement
    with the owners of the copyright of that work. I am also indebted to
    Professor Barrett Wendell, Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., and Messrs.
    Macmillan &amp; Co. for permission to use brief quotations from their works.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <h3>OF GOOD USE</h3>

  <p>Why is it that for the purposes of English composition one word is not so
    good as another? To this question we shall get a general answer if we
    examine the effect of certain classes of expressions.</p>
  <p><strong>Present Use.</strong>&mdash;Let us examine first the effect produced by three
    passages in the authorized version of the English Bible&mdash;a version made by
    order of King James in 1611:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;For these two years hath the famine been in the land, and yet there are
    five years, in the which there shall neither be <em>earing</em> nor harvest&quot;
    (Gen. xlv. 6).</p>
  <p>&quot;O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long
    will ye love vanity, and seek after <em>leasing</em>?&quot; (Psa. iv. 2).</p>
  <p>&quot;Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed
    to come unto you, but was <em>let</em> hitherto&quot; (Rom. i. 18).</p>
  <p>See also Gen. xxv. 29; Matt. iii 8; Acts viii. 3; 1 Thess. iv. 15.</p>
  <p>An ordinary reader of our time cannot without assistance fully understand
    these passages, because the words &quot;earing,&quot; &quot;leasing,&quot; and &quot;let&quot; convey to
    his mind either no idea at all or a wrong idea. Two hundred and eighty
    <span id="pg004"></span>years ago, when this translation of the Bible was made, these words were
    common words with plain meanings; but &quot;earing&quot; and &quot;leasing&quot; have since
    dropped out of common use, and &quot;let&quot; has acquired a different meaning;
    consequently an ordinary reader of the present time must consult a
    dictionary before he can be sure what the passages mean. Words and
    meanings which have gone out of use are called <em>obsolete</em>. There is not
    much temptation to use obsolete words; but the temptation sometimes comes.
    Therefore we note, as our first conclusion, that a person who wishes to be
    understood must avoid expressions and meanings which are not in <em>present
      use</em>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>National Use.</strong>&mdash;A boy from southern Pennsylvania was visiting in New
    York State. In the midst of some preparations for a fishing excursion he
    said to his host, &quot;Shall I take my <em>gums</em> along?&quot; His host burst out
    laughing and said, &quot;Of course; did you think of taking them out of your
    mouth and leaving them at home?&quot;<span id="FNanchor2"></span><a href="#Footnote2">[2]</a> Unconsciously the boy had
    used a good
    English word in a sense peculiar to the district in which he lived; his
    host had understood the word in its proper sense.</p>
  <p>On another occasion a gentleman who had just arrived at a hotel in
    Kennebunkport, Me., agreed to a proposal to &quot;go down to the beach in the
    <em>barge</em>.&quot; Going to his room, he prepared for a little excursion on the
    river which flowed by the hotel. When he returned, he was greatly
    surprised to find his friends about to start for the beach in <em>a large
      omnibus</em>. Another gentleman once asked a young lady to go &quot;<em>riding</em>&quot; with
    him. At the appointed hour he drove to her house in a buggy, and she came
    down to meet him in her riding habit.
  </p>
  <p>These incidents show that if we use expressions that <span id="pg005"></span>are only local, or
    use words in local senses, we are liable either to be misunderstood or not
    to be understood at all. Obscurity also arises from the use of words in
    senses which are peculiar to a certain class or profession. For example,
    to a person who is not familiar with commercial slang, this sentence from
    the market columns of a newspaper is a puzzle:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&quot;Java coffees are <em>dull</em> and <em>easy</em>, though they are <em>statistically
      strong</em>.&quot;</p>
  <p>The following directions for anchoring in a gale of wind are taken from a
    book called &quot;How to Sail a Boat&quot;:&mdash;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;When everything is ready, bring the yacht <em>to the wind</em>, and
      let</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">the sails shake <em>in the wind's eye</em>; and, so soon as she gets</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em>stern-way</em>, let go the <em>best bower</em> anchor, taking care not
      to</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em>snub her</em> too quickly, but to let considerable of the cable run</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">out before checking her; then take a turn or two around the</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em>knight-heads</em>,&quot; etc.</span>
  </p>
  <p>If a landsman's safety depended on his understanding these directions,
    there would not be much hope for him.</p>
  <p>The following extract is from a newspaper report of a game of ball:&mdash;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;In the eighth inning Anson jumped from one box into the other and</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">whacked a wide one into extreme right. It was a three-base jolt</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">and was made when Gastright intended to force the old man to</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">first. The Brooklyns howled and claimed that Anson was out, but</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">McQuaid thought differently. Both teams were crippled. Lange will</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">be laid up for a week or so. One pitcher was batted out of the</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 2em;">box.&quot;</span>
  </p>
  <p>This narrative may seem commonplace to school-boys, but to their mothers
    and sisters it must seem alarming.</p>
  <p>Our second conclusion, therefore, is that a person who wishes to be
    understood must avoid words and phrases that are not understood, and
    understood in the same sense, in <span id="pg006"></span>every part of the country, and in every
    class or profession.<span id="FNanchor3"></span><a href="#Footnote3">[3]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Reputable Use.</strong>&mdash;Let us examine now the effect produced by a third
    kind of expression, namely, words and phrases &quot;not used by writers and
    speakers of established reputation.&quot;<span id="FNanchor4"></span><a href="#Footnote4">[4]</a> Let us take as our
    illustrations
    the familiar expressions, &quot;He <em>done</em> it&quot; and &quot;Please <em>set</em> in this seat.&quot;
    Each of these expressions is common at the present time, and its meaning
    is instantly clear to any one who speaks English. But these expressions,
    not being used by well-informed and careful speakers, produce in the mind
    of a well-informed bearer an impression of vulgarity like that which we
    get from seeing a person eat with his knife. In language, as in manners
    and fashions, the law is found in the custom of the best people; and
    persons who wish to be classed as cultivated people must speak and write
    like cultivated people. There is no moral wrong in a person's saying
    &quot;Please <em>set</em> in this seat,&quot; and if he does say it he will probably be
    understood; but persons who use this or any other expression which is not
    in reputable use run the risk of being classed as ignorant, affected, or
    vulgar.</p>
  <p><strong>Good Use.</strong>&mdash;It appears, therefore, that words and phrases, in order to
    be proper expressions for use in English prose, (1) must be in common use
    at the present time; (2) they must be used, and used in the same sense, in
    every part of the country, and in every class and profession; (3) they
    must be expressions used by writers and speakers of established
    reputation. In other words, our expressions must be in <em>present,
      national</em>, and <em>reputable</em> use. Expressions which fulfil these three
    conditions are said to be in <em>good use</em>.</p>
  <p>The next question that presents itself to one who wishes <span id="pg007"></span>to use English
    correctly is, How am I to know what words and expressions are in good use?</p>
  <p><strong>Conversation and Good Use.</strong>&mdash;Good use cannot be determined solely by
    observing the conversation of our associates; for the chances are that
    they use many local expressions, some slang, and possibly some vulgarisms.
    &quot;You often hear it&quot; is not proof that an expression is in good use.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Newspapers and Good Use.</strong>&mdash;Nor can good use be learned from what we
    see in newspapers. Newspapers of high rank contain from time to time,
    especially in their editorial columns, some of the best modern prose, and
    much literature that has become standard was first printed in periodicals;
    but most of the prose in newspapers is written necessarily by contributors
    who do not belong to the class of &quot;speakers or writers whom the world
    deems the best.&quot; As the newspaper in its news records the life of every
    day, so in its style it too frequently records the slang of daily life and
    the faults of ordinary conversation. A newspaper contains bits of English
    prose from hundreds of different pens, some skilled, some unskilled; and
    this jumble of styles does not determine good use.</p>
  <p><strong>No one Book or Writer Decisive.</strong>&mdash;Nor is good use to be learned from
    our favorite author, unsupported by other authority; not even, as we have
    seen, from the English Bible, when it stands alone. No writer, even the
    greatest, is free from occasional errors; but these accidental slips are
    not to be considered in determining good use. Good use is decided by the
    prevailing usage of the writers whose works make up permanent English
    literature, not by their inadvertencies. &quot;The fact that Shakspere uses a
    word, or Sir Walter Scott, or Burke, or Washington Irving, or whoever
    happens to be writing earnestly in Melbourne or Sidney, does not make it
    reputable. The fact that all five of <span id="pg008"></span>these authorities use the word in
    the same sense would go very far to establish the usage. On the other
    hand, the fact that any number of newspaper reporters agree in usage does
    not make the usage reputable. The style of newspaper reporters is not
    without merit; it is very rarely unreadable; but for all its virtue it is
    rarely a well of English undefiled.&quot;<span id="FNanchor5"></span><a href="#Footnote5">[5]</a></p>
  <p>&quot;Reputable use is fixed, not by the practice of those whom A or B deems
    the best speakers or writers, but by the practice of those whom the world
    deems the best,&mdash;those who are in the best repute, not indeed as to
    thought, but as to expression, the manner of communicating thought. The
    practice of no one writer, however high he may stand in the public
    estimation, is enough to settle a point; but the uniform or nearly uniform
    practice of reputable speakers or writers is decisive.&quot;<span id="FNanchor6"></span><a href="#Footnote6">[6]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Good Reading the Foundation of Good Speaking and Writing.</strong>&mdash;To the
    question how to become familiar with good use the first answer is, read
    the best literature. Language, like manners, is learned for the most part
    by imitation; and a person who is familiar with the language of reputable
    writers and speakers will use good English without conscious effort, just
    as a child brought up among refined people generally has good manners
    without knowing it. Good reading is indispensable to good speaking or
    writing. Without this, rules and dictionaries are of no avail. In reading
    the biographies of eminent writers, it is interesting to note how many of
    them were great readers when they were young; and teachers can testify
    that the best writers among their pupils are those who have read good
    literature or who have been accustomed to hear good English at home. The
    student of expression <span id="pg009"></span>should begin at once to make the acquaintance of
    good literature.</p>
  <p><strong>The Use of Dictionaries.</strong>&mdash;To become acquainted with good literature,
    however, takes a long time; and to decide, by direct reference to the
    usage of the best writers, every question that arises in composition, is
    not possible for beginners. In certain cases beginners must go to
    dictionaries to learn what good use approves. Dictionaries do not make
    good use, but by recording the facts learned by professional investigators
    they answer many questions regarding it. To one who wishes to speak and
    write well a good dictionary is indispensable.</p>
  <p><strong>&quot;The Foundations of Rhetoric.&quot;</strong>&mdash;Dictionaries, however, are not always
    a sufficient guide; for, being records, they aim to give <em>all</em> the senses
    in which a word is used, and do not always tell which sense is approved by
    the best usage. Large dictionaries contain many words which have gone out
    of good use and other words which have not yet come into good use.
    Moreover, they treat of words only, not of constructions and long
    expressions. Additional help in determining good use is required by
    beginners, and this help is to be found in such books as Professor A.S.
    Hill's &quot;Foundations of Rhetoric.&quot; The investigations of a specialist are
    there recorded in a convenient form, with particular reference to the
    needs of beginners and of those who have been under the influence of bad
    models. Common errors are explained and corrected, and the fundamental
    merits of good expression are set forth and illustrated.</p>
  <p><strong>Purpose of these Exercises.</strong>&mdash;In the following exercises, which are
    intended for drill on some of these elements of good expression, care has
    been taken to put the questions into the forms in which they arise in
    actual composition. The notes which precede the exercises are only hints;
    for <br>
    <span id="pg010"></span>full discussions of the principles involved the student must consult<br>
    larger works.

  <h3>OF NOUNS</h3>

  <p><strong>How to Form the Possessive Case.</strong><span id="FNanchor10"></span><a href="#Footnote10">[10]</a>&mdash;As a
    rule, the possessive of
    nouns in the SINGULAR number is formed by adding an apostrophe and &quot;s&quot;
    ('s): as, &quot;The <em>boy's</em> coat.&quot; Often the pronunciation of the added &quot;s&quot;
    makes a new syllable; and if this additional syllable makes an unpleasant
    sound, the possessive is indicated by the apostrophe alone ('): as, &quot;For
    <em>goodness'</em> sake.&quot; The putting in or the leaving out of the &quot;s&quot; in such
    cases is chiefly a matter of taste. If the &quot;s&quot; is sounded, it is always
    written; and whenever there is doubt, it is well to follow the regular
    rule: as, &quot;<em>Horace's</em> odes,&quot; &quot;<em>Charles's</em> ball,&quot; &quot;<em>Dickens's</em> David
    Copperfield.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>In the PLURAL number, when the nominative plural ends in &quot;s,&quot; the
    possessive case is formed by adding an apostrophe alone ('). If the
    nominative plural does not end in &quot;s,&quot; an apostrophe and an &quot;s&quot; ('s) are
    both added, as in the singular: as, &quot;<em>Men's</em> and <em>boys'</em> shoes.&quot;</p>
  <p>The possessive case of COMPOUND nouns and expressions used as compound
    nouns is formed by adding the proper sign of the possessive to the end of
    the compound: as, &quot;That is my <em>sister-in-law's</em> pony,&quot; &quot;This is the
    <em>Prince of Wales's</em> palace.&quot;
  </p>

    monkey, mouse, ox, woman, deer, eagle, princess, elephant, man, witness, prince, fox, farmer, countess, mouth,
    horse, day, year, lion, wolf, thief, Englishman.<br>
    <span id="pg017"></span>2. <em>Write the possessive case of:</em> James, Dickens, his sister Mary, Miss
    Austen, the Prince of Wales, Frederick the Great, Harper and Brothers, father-in-law, Charles, Jones, William the

  </p>
  <p><strong>Use</strong> and <strong>Misuse</strong> of the <strong>Possessive Case.</strong><span
      id="FNanchor12"></span><a href="#Footnote11">[12]</a>&mdash;It is
    sometimes a question whether to use the possessive form or the
    preposition <em>of</em>. &quot;As a general rule, the possessive case should
    be confined to cases of possession.&quot;<span id="FNanchor13"></span><a href="#Footnote13">[13]</a></p>

  <p><strong>EXERCISE VIII.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Express relation between the words in the following pairs by putting one

  <p>Charles the Second, reign; witness, testimony; horse, hoof; the President,
    public reception; Partridge, restaurant; aide-de-camp, horse; General
    Armistead, death; Henry the Eighth, wives; Napoleon, Berlin decree;

    (our, us), midst; year, events; Guiteau, trial; sea, bottom; Essex, death;
    Adams, administration; six months, wages; world, government.</p>
  <p id="Footnote14"><a href="#FNanchor14">[14]</a> There is, properly, no &quot;objective possessive&quot; in
    English
    corresponding to the &quot;objective genitive&quot; in other languages. It seems

  <p><strong>EXERCISE X.</strong></p>

  <p><em>Correct the following, giving the reason for each correction:&mdash;</em><br>
    1. A dog and a cat's head are differently shaped.<br>

  <p><strong>Singular</strong> and <strong>Plural.</strong><span id="FNanchor15"></span><a
      href="#Footnote15">[15]</a>&mdash;In modern English most nouns form the
    plural by adding &quot;s&quot; to the singular. The following variations from this
    rule are important:&mdash;</p>
  <p>
    1. When the added sound of &quot;s&quot; makes an additional syllable, &quot;es&quot; is used: as, box, boxes;
    church, churches.
    <br>
    2. <strong>Nouns ending in &quot;o.&quot;</strong> If the final &quot;o&quot; is preceded by a vowel, the plural is
    formed regularly, i.e., by adding &quot;s&quot;: as, cameo, cameos. If the final &quot;o&quot; is preceded by a
    consonant, the tendency of modern usage is to form the plural by adding &quot;es&quot;: as, hero, heroes; potato,
    potatoes. The following common words, however, seem still to form the plural by adding &quot;s&quot; alone:&mdash;
  </p>
  <table style='border-width:0'>
    <tr>
      <td>canto</td>
      <td>lasso</td>
      <td>proviso&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <td>piano</td>
      <td>stiletto</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    3. <strong>Nouns ending in &quot;y.&quot;</strong> If the &quot;y&quot; is preceded by a vowel, the plural is
    regular: as, valley, valleys.<br>
    If the &quot;y&quot; is preceded by a consonant, &quot;y&quot; is changed to &quot;i&quot; and &quot;es&quot; is
    added to form the plural: as, lady, ladies; city, cities.<br>
    4. <strong>Proper nouns</strong> are changed as little as possible: as, Henry, Henrys; Mary, Marys; Cicero, Ciceros;
    Nero, Neros.<br>
    5. Most <strong>compound nouns</strong> form the plural by adding the proper sign of the plural to the fundamental
    part of the word, i.e., to the part which is described by the rest of the phrase: as, ox-cart, ox-carts;
    court-martial, courts-martial; aide-de-camp, aides-de-camp.
    <br>
    Note the difference between the <em>plural</em> and the <em>possessive</em> of compound nouns,&mdash;forms which are
    often confounded. See page 16.
    <br>
    <span id="pg019"></span>6. Letters, figures, and other symbols are made plural by adding an apostrophe and
    &quot;s&quot; ('s): as, &quot;There are more <em>e's</em> than <em>a's</em> in this word&quot;; &quot;Dot your
    <em>i's</em> and cross your <em>t's</em>.&quot;
    <br>
    7. Some nouns have two plurals, which differ in meaning:&mdash;

  <p><strong>Misused Nouns</strong>.<span id="FNanchor22"></span><a href="#Footnote22">[22]</a>&mdash;Many errors in English
    consist in using words in
    senses which are not authorized. Sometimes the use of a word in a wrong
    sense makes the speaker's meaning obscure. Sometimes it makes him seem
    ridiculous, as when a person of the writer's acquaintance told a friend to
    clean an oil-painting by washing it in &quot;torpid&quot; water.<span id="pg023"></span>In every case the
    misuse of a word leaves an unpleasant impression on the mind of a
    cultivated person, and, like all bad English, should be avoided as we
    avoid bad manners. In the following definitions and exercises a few
    nouns<span id="FNanchor23"></span><a href="#Footnote23">[23]</a> are selected for study. The distinctions given are not
    always
    observed by reputable authors, but they indicate the <em>tendency</em> of the
    best modern usage.</p>
  <p><strong>I. A RESEMBLANCE IN SENSE MISLEADS.</strong><span id="FNanchor24"></span><a href="#Footnote24">[24]</a></p>
  <p><strong>House, home.</strong>&mdash;A <em>house</em> is a building. <em>Home</em> means one's habitual
    abode, &quot;the abiding place of the affections.&quot; It may or may not be in a
    house, and it may include the surroundings of a house.</p>
  <p><strong>Person, party.</strong>&mdash;A <em>person</em> is an individual, a <em>party</em> is a company
    of persons, or, in legal usage, a person who is concerned in a contention
    or agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>Series, succession.</strong>&mdash;A <em>series</em> is a succession of similar things
    mutually related according to some law. <em>Succession</em> is properly used of
    several things following one after the other; it denotes order of
    occurrence only, and does not imply any connection.</p>
  <p><strong>Statement, assertion.</strong>&mdash;A <em>statement</em> is a formal setting forth of
    fact or opinion; an <em>assertion</em> is simply an affirmation of fact or
    opinion.</p>
  <p><strong>Verdict, testimony.</strong>&mdash;A <em>verdict</em> is a decision made by a number of
    men acting as a single body. <em>Testimony</em> is an expression of individual
    knowledge or belief.</p>
  <p><strong>The whole, all.</strong>&mdash;<em>The whole</em> is properly used of something which is
    considered as one thing. When a number of persons or things are spoken of,
    the proper word is <em>all.</em></p>

  <p id="Footnote22"><a href="#FNanchor22">[22]</a> TO THE TEACHER.&mdash;It may not be desirable to drill
    pupils on all the
    words whose meanings are discriminated here and in chapters V. and VI. In
    that case it will be easy to select for study those words which the pupils
    are most likely to misuse. The words discriminated in this book are for
    the most part those which are mentioned in the &quot;Foundations of Rhetoric,&quot;
    and they have been arranged in the same order. A few other words often
    misused by my pupils have been added.

  </p>

  <p>II. A RESEMBLANCE IN SOUND MISLEADS.<span id="FNanchor25"></span><a href="#Footnote25">[25]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Acceptance, acceptation.</strong>&mdash;<em>Acceptance</em> is the &quot;act of accepting&quot;;
    also &quot;favorable reception&quot;: as, &quot;The acceptance of a gift,&quot; &quot;She sang with
    marked acceptance.&quot; <em>Acceptation</em> now means &quot;the sense in which an
    expression is generally understood or accepted.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Access, accession.</strong>&mdash;<em>Access</em> has several meanings authorized by good
    use: (1) outburst; (2) admission; (3) way of entrance. <em>Accession</em> means
    (1) the coming into possession of a right; or (2) an addition.</p>
  <p><strong>Acts, actions.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Acts</em>, in the sense of 'things done,' is preferable
    to <em>actions</em>, since <em>actions</em> also means 'processes of doing.'&quot;<span id="FNanchor26"></span><a
      href="#Footnote26">[26]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Advance, advancement.</strong>&mdash;<em>Advance</em> is used in speaking of something as
    moving forward; <em>advancement</em>, as being moved forward.</p>
  <p><strong>Allusion, illusion, delusion.</strong>&mdash;An <em>allusion</em> is an indirect
    reference to something not definitely mentioned. Roughly speaking, an
    <em>illusion</em> is an error of vision; <em>delusion</em>, of judgment. &quot;In
    literary and popular use an <em>illusion</em> is an unreal appearance presented
    in any way to the bodily or the mental vision; it is often pleasing,
    harmless, or even useful.... A <em>delusion</em> is a mental error or deception,
    and may have regard to things actually existing, as well as to
    <em>illusions</em>. <em>Delusions</em> are ordinarily repulsive and discreditable,
    and may even be mischievous.&quot;<span id="FNanchor27"></span><a href="#Footnote27">[27]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Avocation, vocation.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Vocation</em> means 'calling' or 'profession';
    <em>avocation</em>, 'something aside from one's regular calling, a by-work.'&quot;<span id="FNanchor28"></span><a
      href="#Footnote28">[28]</a>
  </p>
  <p id="pg026"><strong>Completion, completeness.</strong>&mdash;<em>Completion</em> is &quot;the
    act of completing&quot;;
    <em>completeness</em> is &quot;the state of being complete.&quot;
  </p>
  <p><strong>Observation, observance.</strong>&mdash;<em>Observation</em> contains the idea of &quot;looking
    at&quot;; <em>observance</em>, of &quot;keeping,&quot; &quot;celebrating.&quot; &quot;We speak of the
    <em>observation</em>
    of a fact, of a star; of the <em>observance</em> of a festival, of a rule.&quot;<span id="FNanchor29"></span><a
      href="#Footnote29">[29]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Proposal, proposition.</strong>&mdash;&quot;A <em>proposal</em> is something proposed to be
    done, which may be accepted or rejected. A <em>proposition</em> is something
    proposed for discussion, with a view to determining the truth
    or wisdom of it.&quot;<span id="FNanchor30"></span><a href="#Footnote30">[30]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Relationship, relation.</strong>&mdash;<em>Relationship</em> properly means &quot;the state of
    being related by kindred or alliance&quot;: as, &quot;A relationship existed
    between the two families.&quot; <em>Relation</em> is a word of much broader
    meaning. It does not necessarily imply kinship.</p>
  <p><strong>Solicitude, solicitation.</strong>&mdash;<em>Solicitude</em> is &quot;anxiety&quot;; <em>solicitation</em>
    is &quot;the
    act of soliciting or earnestly asking.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Stimulation, stimulus, stimulant.</strong>&mdash;<em>Stimulation</em> is &quot;the act of stimulating
    or inciting to action&quot;; <em>stimulus</em>, originally &quot;a goad,&quot; now denotes
    that which stimulates, the means by which one is incited to
    action; <em>stimulant</em> has a medical sense, being used of that which
    stimulates the body or any of its organs. We speak of ambition as
    a <em>stimulus</em>, of alcohol as a <em>stimulant</em>.</p>

  <p>III. ADDITIONAL NOUNS SOMETIMES MISUSED.<span id="FNanchor31"></span><a href="#Footnote31">[31]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Ability, capacity.</strong>&mdash;<em>Ability</em> is the power of doing; <em>capacity</em>, the
    power of containing, of understanding, of acquiring.</p>
  <p><strong>Adherence, adhesion.</strong>&mdash;<em>Adherence</em> is used of moral relations,
    <em>adhesion</em>, of physical connection. We speak of the <em>adhesion</em> of glue to
    wood, of a man's <em>adherence</em> to the principles of his party.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Amount, quantity, number.</strong>&mdash;<em>Amount</em> means &quot;sum total,&quot; and is used of
    numbers or quantities; <em>quantity</em> is used of things which are measured;
    <em>number</em>, of things which are counted.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Argument, plea.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Plea</em> (in the legal sense) is properly used of the
    pleadings or the arraignment before a trial, not of the <em>argument</em> at a
    trial. A <em>plea</em> is always addressed to the court; an <em>argument</em> may be
    addressed either to the court or to the jury. A similar remark applies to
    the verbs <em>plead</em> and <em>argue</em>.&quot;<span id="FNanchor32"></span><a href="#Footnote32">[32]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Balance, rest, remainder.</strong>&mdash;<em>Balance</em>, meaning &quot;the difference between
    two sides of an account,&quot; is a commercial term, and cannot properly be
    used for <em>rest</em> or <em>remainder. Rest</em> is used of persons or <span id="pg030"></span>things, and
    of
    large as well as of small parts. <em>Remainder</em> is used only of things, and
    denotes a comparatively small part.</p>
  <p><strong>Centre, middle.</strong>&mdash;The <em>centre</em> is a point, or a definite place; the
    <em>middle</em> is a line, or a space, and is less definite than <em>centre</em>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Character, reputation.</strong>&mdash;<em>Character</em> is what a man is; <em>reputation</em> is
    the prevailing opinion of his character.</p>
  <p><strong>Complement, compliment.</strong>&mdash;A <em>complement</em> is a &quot;full quantity or
    number&quot; or &quot;that which is needed to complete&quot;; a <em>compliment</em> is &quot;an
    expression of praise.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Conscience, consciousness.</strong>&mdash;<em>Conscience</em> is that within us which
    distinguishes right from wrong. <em>Consciousness</em> is the state of being
    aware of one's existence, thoughts, and surroundings.</p>
  <p id="pg036"></p>
  <p><strong>Council, counsel.</strong>&mdash;A <em>council</em> is &quot;a body of persons convened for
    consultation.&quot; <em>Counsel</em> denotes &quot;advice,&quot; or &quot;a person, as a lawyer,
    engaged to give advice.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Custom, habit.</strong>&mdash;<em>Custom</em> denotes the frequent repetition of the same
    act, and may be used of a number of persons taken together. <em>Habit</em> is the
    effect of custom in a person. <em>Custom</em> is voluntary; <em>habit</em> is
    involuntary, often uncontrollable, sometimes unconscious.</p>
  <p><strong>Deception, deceit.</strong>&mdash;<em>Deception</em> is &quot;the act of deceiving&quot;; <em>deceit</em>
    is &quot;deceitfulness,&quot; a trait of character; or a &quot;trick,&quot; an &quot;artifice.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Egoists, egoism, egotism.</strong>&mdash;&quot;The disciples of Descartes were
    <em>egoists</em>, the <em>ego</em> being the basis of their philosophy.&quot; <em>Egoism</em> is the
    name of their system. <em>Egoism</em> is sometimes used also in the sense of
    undue admiration of self, the outward expression of which is <em>egotism</em>.
    But &quot;<em>egotism</em>, in the sense of 'self-worship,' is preferable to <em>egoism</em>,
    since <em>egoism</em> also designates a system of philosophy.&quot;<span id="FNanchor33"></span><a
      href="#Footnote33">[33]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Emigration, immigration.</strong>&mdash;<em>Emigration</em> is the moving out from a
    country; <em>immigration</em>, the moving into it. Foreigners who come to live in
    America are <em>emigrants</em> from their fatherland, <em>immigrants</em> to America.</p>
  <p><strong>Enormity, enormousness.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Enormity</em> is used of deeds of unusual
    horror; <em>enormousness</em>, of things of unusual size. We speak of the
    <em>enormity</em> of C&aelig;sar Borgia's crimes, of the <em>enormousness</em> of the
    Rothschilds' wealth.&quot;<span id="FNanchor34"></span><a href="#Footnote34">[34]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Esteem, estimate, estimation.</strong>&mdash;<em>Esteem</em> as a noun seems to be going
    out of use; the word now commonly used in the sense of &quot;opinion&quot; <span id="pg031"></span>or
    &quot;regard&quot; is <em>estimation</em>. An <em>estimate</em> is &quot;an approximate judgment, based
    on considerations of probability, of the number, amount, magnitude, or
    position of anything.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Falsity, falseness.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Falsity</em>, in the sense of 'non-conformity to
    truth,' without any suggestion of blame, is preferable to <em>falseness</em>,
    since <em>falseness</em> usually implies blame.&quot;<span id="FNanchor35"></span><a href="#Footnote35">[35]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Identity, identification.</strong>&mdash;<em>Identity</em> is &quot;the state of being the
    same.&quot; <em>Identification</em> denotes &quot;the act of determining what a given
    thing, or who a given person, is.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Import, importance.</strong>&mdash;<em>Import</em>, in the sense of &quot;meaning,&quot; must be
    distinguished from <em>importance</em>, &quot;the quality of being important.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Invention, discovery.</strong>&mdash;We <em>invent</em> something new, contrived or
    produced for the first time. We <em>discover</em> what existed before, but
    remained unknown.</p>
  <p><strong>Limit, limitation.</strong>&mdash;<em>Limit</em>, in the sense of &quot;bound,&quot; is preferable
    to <em>limitation</em>, since <em>limitation</em> also means &quot;the act of limiting,&quot; or a
    &quot;restriction.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Lot, number.</strong>&mdash;<em>Lot</em> denotes &quot;a distinct part or parcel&quot;: as, &quot;The
    auctioneer sold the goods in ten <em>lots</em>.&quot; The word does not mean &quot;a great
    number&quot;; therefore it is improperly used in the sentences: &quot;He has <em>lots</em>
    of money,&quot; and &quot;I know a <em>lot</em> of people in New York.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Majority, plurality.</strong>&mdash;A <em>majority</em> is more than half the whole
    number; a <em>plurality</em> is the excess of votes given for one candidate over
    those given for another, and is not necessarily a <em>majority</em> when there
    are more than two candidates.</p>
  <p><strong>Negligence, neglect.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Negligence</em> is used of a habit or trait;
    <em>neglect</em>, of an act or succession of acts.&quot;<span id="FNanchor36"></span><a href="#Footnote36">[36]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Novice, novitiate.</strong>&mdash;<em>Novice</em> properly means one who is new in any
    business or calling; <em>novitiate</em>, the state or time of being a <em>novice</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Organism, organization.</strong>&mdash;An <em>organism</em> is a &quot;living body composed of
    a number of essential parts.&quot; <em>Organization</em> denotes &quot;the act of
    organizing,&quot; or &quot;an organized body of persons,&quot; as a literary society.</p>
  <p><strong>Part, portion.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Part</em> is the general word for that which is less
    than the whole: as, the whole is equal to the sum of all its <em>parts</em>....
    <em>Portion</em> is often used in a stilted way where <em>part</em> would be simpler and
    better; <em>portion</em> has always some suggestion of allotment or <span id="pg032"></span>assignment:
    as, this is my <em>portion</em>; a <em>portion</em> of Scripture. 'Father, give me the
    <em>portion</em> of goods that falleth to me.'&quot;<span id="FNanchor37"></span><a href="#Footnote37">[37]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Plenty, abundance</strong>.&mdash;<em>Plenty</em> is enough; <em>abundance</em>, more than enough.</p>
  <p><strong>Produce, product, production</strong>.&mdash;<em>Produce</em> is always collective, and is
    used only of raw products: as, the <em>produce</em> of the soil, of the flock.
    <em>Product</em> denotes the result of some operation, usually physical labor.
    <em>Production</em>, meaning &quot;the act of producing,&quot; is also applied to a
    work of literature or art, as a book, a statue, or a painting. &quot;<em>Product</em>,
    in the sense of 'thing produced,' is preferable to <em>production</em>, since
    <em>production</em> is also used in an abstract sense.&quot;<span id="FNanchor38"></span><a href="#Footnote38">[38]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Prominence, predominance</strong>.&mdash;<em>Prominence</em> means &quot;a standing out
    from something, so as to be conspicuous.&quot; <em>Predominance</em> denotes
    &quot;ascendency,&quot; &quot;a superiority in strength or influence,&quot; &quot;an over-ruling.&quot;
    There may be many <em>prominent</em> traits in a person's character;
    there can be only one <em>predominant</em> trait.</p>
  <p><strong>Receipt, recipe</strong>.&mdash;&quot;<em>Receipt</em>, in the sense of 'formula for a pudding,
    etc.,' is preferable to <em>recipe</em>, since <em>recipe</em> is commonly restricted to
    medical prescriptions.&quot;<a href="#Footnote38">[38]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Relative, relation</strong>.&mdash;&quot;<em>Relative</em>, in the sense of 'member of a family,' is
    preferable to <em>relation</em>, since <em>relation</em> is also used in an abstract sense.&quot;<a
      href="#Footnote38">[38]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Requirement, requisite, requisition</strong>.&mdash;A <em>requirement</em> is something
    required by a person or persons. A <em>requisite</em> is something required
    by the nature of the case. A <em>requisition</em> is an authoritative demand
    or official request for a supply of something.</p>
  <p><strong>Resort, recourse, resource</strong>.&mdash;<em>Resort</em> denotes &quot;the act of going to
    some person or thing&quot;; or &quot;that which is resorted to or habitually
    visited.&quot; <em>Recourse</em> means &quot;resort for help or protection.&quot; <em>Resource</em>
    denotes &quot;something which is a source of help or support.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Secreting, secretion</strong>.&mdash;<em>Secreting</em> is the act of hiding; <em>secretion</em>, a
    physiological process or fluid.</p>
  <p><strong>Sewage, sewerage</strong>.&mdash;<em>Sewage</em> means the contents, <em>sewerage</em>, the
    system, of sewers.</p>
  <p><strong>Situation, site</strong>.&mdash;&quot;<em>Situation</em> embraces all the local aspects and
    relationships<span id="FNanchor39"></span><a href="#Footnote39">[39]</a> in which a thing is placed. The <em>site</em>
    is confined to the
    ground on which it is erected or reposes.&quot;<span id="FNanchor40"></span><a href="#Footnote40">[40]</a></p>
  <p id="pg033"></p>
  <p><strong>Speciality, specialty.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Speciality</em>, in the sense of 'distinctive
    quality,' is preferable to <em>specialty</em>, since <em>specialty</em> is also used in the sense
    of 'distinctive thing.'&quot;<span id="FNanchor41"></span><a href="#Footnote41">[41]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Union, unity.</strong>&mdash;<em>Union</em> is &quot;the joining of two or more things into
    one.&quot; <em>Unity</em> means &quot;oneness,&quot; &quot;harmony.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Visitant, visitor.</strong>&mdash;<em>Visitant</em> was formerly used to denote a supernatural
    being; <em>visitor</em>, a human one. <em>Visitant</em> seems now to be going
    out of use, <em>visitor</em> being used in both senses.</p>

    difficulty which
    this exercise presents to pupils. In assigning the lesson care must be
    taken not to call for more of this kind of work than can be done well.
    Constructing a sentence to illustrate the correct use of a word is a
    valuable exercise, but it is a difficult one; and persons who know the
    correct use of a word may be put to their wit's end to illustrate that
    use. It will be well to assign this exercise little by little, while the
    class works through the definitions and exercises on pages 23-41; or else
    to select from the list the words on which the class needs most drill.
    With some pupils it may be wise to omit the exercise entirely.</p>

  <p><strong>Nominative or Objective Case.<span id="FNanchor47"></span><a href="#Footnote47">[47]</a></strong>&mdash;There
    are only seven words in the
    English language that now have different <span id="pg044"></span>forms for the nominative and

    need to observe any rules about &quot;nominative&quot; or &quot;objective.&quot; Since,
    however, these seven words are more frequently used than any other words,
    the possibilities of error in choosing between the nominative and the
    objective are many. Mistakes of this kind are common, and produce a very
    unpleasant effect on cultivated people. The seven words that have

  <p>It is taken for granted that the student has already learned the following<br>
    principles of syntax:&mdash;
    <br>
    1. <em>Words used absolutely</em> and the <em>subjects of finite verbs</em> should in
    English be put in the NOMINATIVE form.<br>
    2. The <em>subjects of infinitives</em> and the <em>objects</em> of verbs and
    prepositions should be in the OBJECTIVE form.<br>
    3. Words in <em>apposition</em> should be in the same case.<br>
    4. The verb &quot;<em>to be,&quot;</em> or any of its forms <em>(am, is, are, were,</em> etc.),
    does not take an object, but, being equivalent in meaning to the symbol
    &quot;=,&quot; takes the same case after it as before it: the nominative,
    if the form is &quot;finite&quot;; the objective, if the form is &quot;infinitive&quot; and
    has a subject of its own. &quot;I know it is <em>he</em>,&quot; &quot;I know it to be <em>him,&quot;</em>
    and &quot;The stranger is thought to be <em>he</em>&quot; are grammatically correct.
  </p>
  <p>Sentences like &quot;She invited Mrs. R. and <em>I</em> to go driving&quot; are common,
    even among people generally well-informed. Such mistakes will be avoided
    if the speaker stops to think what the form would be if the pronoun were
    not coupled with a noun. No one would think of saying, &quot;She invited <em>I</em> to
    go driving.&quot;</p>
  <p>Persons who are in doubt as to which form of the pronoun to use often try
    to avoid the difficulty by using one of the pronouns ending in
    &quot;-self&quot;&mdash;pronouns which have the same form for both the nominative and the
    objective case. Thus many persons, uncertain whether to use &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot; in
    the sentence quoted above, would say instead, &quot;She invited Mrs. R. and
    <em>myself</em> to go driving.&quot; This is <span id="pg045"></span>no better than &quot;Mrs. R. and
    <em>I</em>,&quot; or
    &quot;her and <em>I</em>.&quot; The pronouns in &quot;-self&quot; are properly used only for emphasis
    or in a reflexive sense.<span id="FNanchor49"></span><a href="#Footnote49">[49]</a> It is right to say: &quot;I will go
    <em>myself</em>&quot;;
    &quot;Carrie <em>herself</em> went to the door &quot;; &quot;God helps those who help
    <em>themselves</em>.&quot; It would be wrong to say, &quot;Harry and <em>myself</em> have bought a
    horse together.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>When a pronoun in &quot;-self&quot; is used reflexively, it refers to the subject of
    the clause in which it stands.</p>
  <p>In sentences like &quot;This advice is free to <em>whoever</em> will take it,&quot; the
    word ending in &quot;-ever&quot; is the subject of the verb &quot;will take,&quot; not the
    object of the preposition &quot;to.&quot; The right form, therefore, is &quot;whoever,&quot;
    not &quot;whomever.&quot; The object or, better, the &quot;base&quot; of the preposition &quot;to&quot;
    is the whole clause, &quot;whoever will take it.&quot;</p>

  <p><strong>Pronouns before Verbal Nouns.<span id="FNanchor52"></span><a
        href="#Footnote52">[52]</a></strong>&mdash;Grammarians distinguish three kinds<br>
    of words formed from verbs by the adding of &quot;-ing.&quot;</p>
  <p>
    1. &quot;We found Katharine <em>singing</em> a merry song.&quot; In this sentence
    &quot;singing&quot;&mdash;equivalent to &quot;who was singing&quot;&mdash;describes Katharine, and is
    therefore used as an adjective; but it also partakes of the nature of a
    verb, for it has a direct object, &quot;song.&quot; Such words, partaking of the
    nature of both adjective and verb, are called PARTICIPLES.<br>
    2. &quot;Blithely <em>singing</em> pretty songs keeps one's spirits up.&quot;</p>
  <p id="pg051"></p>
  <p>Here &quot;singing&quot; is a noun, the subject of the sentence; yet it has a direct
    object, &quot;songs,&quot; and is modified by the adverb &quot;blithely.&quot; Such words,
    partaking of the nature of both noun and verb, are called GERUNDS.</p>
  <p>A noun or a pronoun used before a gerund to denote the subject of the
    action should be put in the possessive case. The reason for this becomes
    evident if, in the sentence &quot;Do you remember <em>Katharine (Katharine's)
      singing?&quot;</em> we substitute for the noun &quot;singing&quot; another noun, &quot;song;&quot;
    thus, &quot;Do you remember <em>Katharine (Katharine's) song?&quot;</em> The direct object
    of &quot;remember&quot; is &quot;singing,&quot; which is described by the possessive
    &quot;Katharine's.&quot;</p>
  <p>3. &quot;Katharine's blithe <em>singing</em> of merry songs helps to make home happy.&quot;
    Here, too, &quot;singing&quot; is a noun; but now its verbal character has
    disappeared, for it is modified by an adjective &quot;blithe,&quot; and instead of a
    direct object we have the prepositional phrase &quot;of merry songs.&quot; Such
    words derived from verbs are ABSTRACT VERBAL NOUNS.</p>
  <p>When a word in &quot;-ing&quot; is modified by &quot;the&quot; or some other adjective, it is
    an abstract verbal noun, and cannot have an object. Conversely, if it, is
    followed by &quot;of&quot; and a noun instead of by a direct object, it should be
    modified by &quot;the&quot; or some other adjective.</p>

  <p id="Footnote51"><a href="#FNanchor51">[51]</a> In the first of these sentences the pronoun to be supplied
    is the
    subject of &quot;is honest,&quot; and &quot;I know&quot; is parenthetical. In the second
    sentence, the pronoun to be supplied is the subject of &quot;to be honest,&quot;
    which is the complement of &quot;I know.&quot;

  <p><strong>Choice of Relative Pronouns.</strong><span id="FNanchor53"></span><a
      href="#Footnote53">[53]</a>&mdash;<em>Who</em> is now used only of persons;
    <em>which</em>, of things; <em>that</em>, of either persons or things. As a rule,
    euphony decides between <em>who</em> or <em>which</em> and <em>that</em>.
  </p>
  <p>&quot;<em>Who</em> is used chiefly of persons (though also often of the higher
    animals), <em>which</em> almost only of animals and things (in old English also
    of persons), and <em>that</em> indifferently of either, except after a
    preposition, where only <em>who</em> [<em>whom</em>] or <em>which</em> can stand. Some recent
    authorities teach that only <em>that</em> should be used when the relative clause
    is limiting or defining: as, the man <em>that</em> runs fastest wins the race;
    but <em>who</em> or <em>which</em> when it is descriptive or co-ordinating: as, this
    man, <em>who</em> ran fastest, won the race; but, though present usage is perhaps
    tending in the direction of such a distinction, it neither has been nor is
    a rule of English speech, nor is it likely to become one, especially on
    account of the impossibility of setting <em>that</em> after a preposition; for to
    turn all relative clauses into the form 'the house <em>that</em> Jack lived <em>in</em>'
    (instead of 'the house <em>in which</em> Jack lived') would be intolerable. In
    good punctuation the defining relative is distinguished (as in the
    examples above) by never taking a comma before it, whether it be <em>who</em> or
    <em>which</em> or <em>that</em>. Wherever <em>that</em> could be properly used, but only there,
    the relative may be, and very often is, <span id="pg054"></span>omitted altogether; thus, the
    house Jack built or lived in; the man he built it for.&quot;<span id="FNanchor54"></span><a href="#Footnote54">[54]</a>
  </p>
  <p>When the antecedent includes both persons and things,
    <em>that</em> is preferable to <em>who</em> or <em>which</em>.
  </p>
  <p>&quot;When the antecedent is a neuter noun not personified, a writer should
    prefer <em>of which</em> to <em>whose</em>, unless euphony requires the latter.&quot;<span id="FNanchor55"></span><a
      href="#Footnote55">[55]</a></p>
  <p><em>What</em>, as a relative pronoun, is equivalent to &quot;that which.&quot; It is never
    used with an antecedent, since the antecedent is included in the meaning
    of the word.</p>
  <p>The word <em>as</em> is a relative pronoun only after &quot;such&quot; or &quot;same.&quot; After
    &quot;such&quot; the proper relative is &quot;as&quot;; after &quot;same&quot; it is &quot;as&quot; or
    &quot;that.&quot;

    for &quot;do not,&quot; or &quot;doesn't&quot; for &quot;does not,&quot; would seem stiff. Care should,
    however, be taken not to use plural contractions for singular, or singular
    for plural. <em>Don't</em> is a contraction of &quot;do not,&quot; <em>doesn't</em> of &quot;does not.&quot;
    The proper contraction of &quot;is not&quot; is <em>isn't;</em> of &quot;are not,&quot; <em>aren't.
      Daresn't</em>, if used at all, should be used only when &quot;dares not&quot; might be
    substituted. <em>Ain't</em> is a gross vulgarism.</p>

  </p>
  <p><strong>Will or shall</strong>.<span id="FNanchor73"></span><a href="#Footnote73">[73]</a>&mdash;Some grammarians teach
    that the future tense of
    &quot;go&quot; is: &quot;I <em>shall</em> or <em>will</em> go,&quot; &quot;You <em>shall</em> or <em>will</em>
    go,&quot; &quot;He <em>shall</em>
    or <em>will</em> go,&quot; etc. The fact seems to be that there is only one form for
    the future; the other form, often given as an alternative, expresses
    something more than futurity, and is somewhat like a distinct mode.</p>
  <p>A help to the proper use of <em>shall</em> and <em>will</em> is found in the original
    meaning of the words. At first <em>shall</em> and <em>will</em> were notional verbs,<span id="FNanchor74"></span><a
      href="#Footnote74">[74]</a>
    <em>shall</em> meaning &quot;to owe,&quot; &quot;to be obliged,&quot; and <em>will</em> meaning &quot;to wish:&quot;
    as, &quot;That faith I <em>shall</em> (owe) to God.&quot;<span id="FNanchor75"></span><a href="#Footnote75">[75]</a> At
    present <em>shall</em> and <em>will</em>
    often retain some trace of their original meaning, <em>will</em> implying a
    reference to the will of the subject, and <em>shall</em> implying obligation or
    compulsion: as, &quot;I <em>will</em> follow him to the end;&quot; &quot;He <em>shall</em> be brought
    to justice;&quot; sometimes they are mere auxiliaries, with no trace of their
    original meaning: as, &quot;It <em>will</em> rain to-day;&quot; &quot;I <em>shall</em> be glad.&quot;
  </p>
  <p id="Footnote73"><a href="#FNanchor73">[73]</a> &quot;Foundations,&quot; pp. 83-88.
    <span id="Footnote74"></span><a href="#FNanchor74">[74]</a> By &quot;notional verb&quot; is meant a verb that has some
    distinct idea or
    notion of its own: as, &quot;I <em>have</em> a ball.&quot; Here &quot;have&quot; expresses the idea
    of possession. In the sentence &quot;I <em>have</em> lost my ball,&quot; the word &quot;have&quot;
    does not express a distinct idea; it only helps to form a tense of the
    verb &quot;lose&quot;: that is, it is not notional, but auxiliary.

  <p><strong>II. IN DEPENDENT SENTENCES.</strong></p>
  <p>In noun clauses introduced by &quot;that,&quot; expressed or understood, if the noun
    clause and the principal clause have <em>different subjects,</em> the distinction
    between <em>shall</em> and <em>will</em> is the same as in independent sentences: as,</p>
  <p>My sister says (that) Dorothy <em>will</em> be glad to go with us. (Futurity; the
    same as, &quot;Dorothy <em>will</em> be glad to go with us.&quot;)</p>
  <p>My sister says (that) Dorothy <em>shall</em> not be left behind. (Volition; the
    same as, "Dorothy _shall_ not be left behind.")</p>
  <p>In all other dependent clauses, <em>shall</em> is in all persons the proper
    auxiliary to express simple futurity; <em>will</em> in all persons implies an
    exercise of will on the part of the subject of the clause: as,</p>
  <p>Dorothy says (that) she <em>shall</em> (futurity) be able to go with us.
    She says (that) she <em>will</em> (volition) meet us at the corner.
    If Bessie <em>will</em> come (volition), we will try to make her visit pleasant.
    When He <em>shall</em> appear (futurity) we shall be like Him.</p>
  <p>REMARK.&mdash;It is worthy of notice that in noun clauses introduced by
    &quot;that&quot;&mdash;clauses which are really indirect quotations&mdash;the same auxiliary
    is generally used that would be used were the quotation in the direct
    form: as, &quot;My sister says, 'Dorothy <em>will</em> be glad to go with you,'&quot; &quot;My
    sister says that Dorothy <em>will</em> be glad to go with us;&quot; &quot;Dorothy says, 'I
    <em>shall</em> be glad to go with you,'&quot; &quot;Dorothy says that she <em>shall</em> be glad
    to go with us.&quot; This remark, however, is not an adequate statement of the
    best usage, for it is not true of such sentences as 21, p. 76, and 8, 22, p. 77.
  </p>
  <p id="pg074"></p>
  <p><strong>III</strong>. IN QUESTIONS.</p>
  <p>In <em>the first person</em> &quot;will&quot; is never proper, except when it repeats a
    question asked by another person. &quot;Will I go?&quot; would mean, &quot;Is it my
    intention to go?&quot;&mdash;a useless question, since the speaker must know his own
    will without asking.</p>
  <p>In the <em>second and third persons</em> the auxiliary which is expected in the
    answer should be used.</p>
  <p>Will you dine with me to-morrow? I will. (Volition.) Shall you be glad to
    come? I shall. (Futurity.) Will your brother be there, too? He will.
    (Futurity.)</p>
  <p><strong>Would or should.</strong><span id="FNanchor78"></span><a
      href="#Footnote78">[78]</a>&mdash;&quot;<em>Should</em> and <em>would</em> follow the same rules as
    <em>shall</em> and <em>will</em>, but they have in addition certain meanings peculiarly
    their own.
  </p>
  <p>&quot;<em>Should</em> is sometimes used in its original sense of 'ought,' as in 'You
    should not do that.'</p>
  <p>&quot;<em>Would</em> is sometimes used to signify habitual action, as in 'The 'Squire
    would sometimes fall asleep in the most pathetic part of my sermon;' and
    to express a wish, as, 'Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,
    my son!'&quot;<span id="FNanchor79"></span><a href="#Footnote79">[79]</a></p>

  <p id="pg078"></p>
  <p><strong>Questions of Tense.</strong><span id="FNanchor80"></span><a href="#Footnote80">[80]</a>&mdash;The tense of a
    verb should correctly express
    the time referred to. Most errors in the use of tenses are violations of
    some one of the following principles, which are established by good
    usage:&mdash;</p>
  <p>1. Principal verbs referring to the same time should be in the same tense.
    2. The <em>perfect indicative</em> &gt;represents something as now completed&mdash;as
    begun in the past but continuing till the present, at least in its
    consequences: as, &quot;I <em>have lost</em> my book&quot; (so that now I do not have it);
    &quot;This house <em>has stood</em> for ninety years&quot; (it is still standing); &quot;Bishop
    Brooks <em>has died,</em> but he <em>has left</em> us his example&quot; (he is not now among
    us, but we have his example).<br>
    3. The tense of the verb in a dependent clause varies with the tense of
    the principal verb:<span id="FNanchor81"></span><a href="#Footnote81">[81]</a> as,<br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I <em>know</em> he <em>will</em> come.</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I <em>knew</em> he <em>would</em> come.</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I <em>have taken</em> the first train, that I <em>may</em> arrive
      early.</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">I <em>had taken</em> the first train, that I <em>might</em> arrive
      early.</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Blanche <em>will be</em> frightened if she <em>sees</em> the bat.</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Blanche <em>would be</em> frightened if she <em>saw</em> the bat.</span><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Blanche <em>would have been</em> frightened if she <em>had seen</em> the bat.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Present facts and unchangeable truths, however, should be expressed in the
    present tense, regardless of the tense of the principal verb: as, &quot;What
    did you say his name <em>is</em>?&quot;<br>
    4. The <em>perfect infinitive</em> is properly used to denote action which is
    completed at the time denoted by the principal verb: as, &quot;I am glad <em>to</em>
    <em>have seen</em> Niagara Falls;&quot; &quot;He felt sorry <em>to have hurt</em> your feelings.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>EXCEPTION.&mdash;<em>Ought, must, need,</em> and <em>should</em> (in the sense of &quot;ought&quot;)
    have no distinctive form to denote past time; with these verbs present
    <span id="pg079"></span>time is denoted by putting the complementary infinitive in the present
    tense, past time is denoted by putting the complementary infinitive in the
    perfect tense: as, &quot;You ought <em>to go</em>,&quot; &quot;You ought <em>to have gone</em>;&quot; &quot;He
    should <em>be</em> careful,&quot; &quot;He should <em>have been</em> careful.&quot; A similar change
    from the present to the perfect infinitive is found after <em>could</em> and
    <em>might</em> in some of their uses: as, &quot;I could <em>go</em>,&quot; &quot;I could <em>have gone</em>;&quot;
    &quot;You might <em>have answered</em>.&quot;

  <p><strong>Indicative or Subjunctive.</strong><span id="FNanchor82"></span><a href="#Footnote82">[82]</a>&mdash;The modern
    tendency to drop the
    subjunctive is unfortunate, for the distinction between the subjunctive
    and the indicative is too useful to be abandoned.<span id="FNanchor83"></span><a href="#Footnote83">[83]</a> A knowledge
    of the
    difference between these modes in English is especially important in view
    of the difficulty which pupils complain of in mastering the uses of the
    Latin subjunctive or the Greek subjunctive and optative.<span id="FNanchor84"></span><a href="#Footnote84">[84]</a> For
    these
    reasons more space is given to the subjunctive in this book than would be
    called for by a mere discussion of modern English usage.</p>
  <p id="pg083"></p>
  <p><strong>Forms</strong> of the <strong>Subjunctive</strong>&mdash;In form the English
    subjunctive differs from the indicative in several ways:&mdash;</p>
  <p>1. In the single case of the verb <em>to be</em> there are distinct
    forms for the present and past tenses, namely:&mdash;</p>


  <table style='border-width:0'>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="4">
        <div class="center"><em>Present</em>.</div>

    <tr>
      <td>thou,&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>you</td>
      <td>thou <em>wert</em>,&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>you</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>he,</td>
      <td>they</td>
      <td>he <em>were,</em></td>
      <td>they</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>EXAMPLES.&mdash;&quot;See that my room <em>be</em><span id="FNanchor85"></span><a href="#Footnote85">[85]</a> got ready
    at once.&quot; &quot;I will work you
    a banner if you <em>be</em><span id="Footnote85"></span><a href="#FNanchor85">[85]</a> victorious.&quot; &quot;The
    headsman feels if the axe
    <em>be</em>[85] sharp.&quot; &quot;Take care lest you <em>be</em> deceived.&quot; &quot;Judge not that ye
    <em>be</em> not judged.&quot; &quot;I will beard them, though they <em>be</em>[85] more fanged than
    wolves and bears.&quot; &quot;If I <em>were</em> you, I would not say that.&quot; &quot;If you
    <em>were</em> more studious, you would rank high.&quot; &quot;Would that my parents <em>were</em>
    here!&quot;
  </p>
  <p>2. In <em>other verbs</em> the subjunctive form is distinguishable
    from the indicative in the second and third persons singular
    by the absence of the personal endings <em>-th,-s</em>, or <em>-st</em>: as,</p>
  <p>
    <em>Present Indicative</em>: I have, thou hast, he has (hath).<br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><em>Subjunctive</em>: I have, thou have, he have.</span>
    <br>
    <em>Past Indicative</em>: I had, thou hadst, he had.<br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><em>Subjunctive</em>: I had, thou had, he had.</span><br>
    <br>
    <em>Present Indicative</em>: I come, thou comest, he comes (cometh).<br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><em>Subjunctive</em>: I come, thou come, he come.</span><br>
    <br>
    <em>Past Indicative</em>: I came, thou earnest, he came.<br>
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><em>Subjunctive</em>: I came, thou came, he came.</span>

  <p id="Footnote82"><a href="#FNanchor82">[82]</a> &quot;Foundations,&quot; pp. 98-101.<br>
    <span id="Footnote83"></span><a href="#FNanchor83">[83]</a> &quot;Some people seem to think that the subjunctive mood is
    as good as
    lost, that it is doomed, and that its retention is hopeless. If its
    function were generally appreciated, it might even now be saved.... If we
    lose the Subjunctive Verb, it will certainly be a grievous impoverishment
    to our literary language, were it only for its value in giving variation
    to diction&mdash;and I make bold to assert that the writer who helps to keep it
    up deserves public gratitude.&quot;&mdash;John Earle: English Prose, its Elements,
    History, and Usage, p. 172.<br>
    <span id="Footnote84"></span><a href="#FNanchor84">[84]</a> &quot;The lecturer also put in a plea for more vitality in
    the teaching of
    English, which ought to be made the gate to other languages. Many of the
    difficult questions of Latin syntax might be examined in the field of
    English, if only we were careful to treat our English critically. Whereas
    most grammars cut the ground from under them by denying the existence of a
    Subjunctive Mood. Until teachers recognize generally that, in such a
    sentence as 'If he had done it, it had been better,' we have a Subjunctive
    in both clauses, and a sentence essentially different from 'If he had
    loved her before, he now adored her,' English must forfeit half its value,
    both as a mental discipline and as a means of approach to Latin, Greek,
    and German.&quot;&mdash;From a report of a Lecture by Prof. Sonnenschein, of the
    Mason College, quoted in Earle's &quot;English Prose,&quot; p. 55.
    [85] In such sentences the indicative would be, according to modern usage,
    correct, and it is more common.
  </p>
  <p id="pg084"></p>
  <p>EXAMPLES.&mdash;&quot;Long <em>live</em> the king!&quot; &quot;If thou <em>go</em>, see that thou <em>offend</em>
    not.&quot; &quot;It is better he <em>die</em>.&quot; &quot;Though he <em>slay</em> me, yet will I trust
    him.&quot; &quot;Unless he <em>behave</em><span id="FNanchor86"></span><a href="#Footnote86">[86]</a> better, he will be
    punished.&quot; &quot;If I will that
    he <em>tarry</em> till I come, what is that to thee?&quot; &quot;Govern well thy appetite,
    lest sin <em>surprise</em> thee.&quot; &quot;If my sister <em>saw</em> this snake, she would be
    frightened.&quot; &quot;I wish I <em>knew</em> where Charles is.&quot;</p>
  <p>The perfect and pluperfect subjunctives are of course formed by means of
    the subjunctive present and past tenses of &quot;have.&quot;</p>
  <p>3. Very often, instead of the simple subjunctive forms, we use auxiliary
    verbs&mdash;<em>may</em> (past, <em>might</em>) and <em>would</em> or <em>should</em>&mdash;to express the
    subjunctive idea. &quot;May&quot; (&quot;might&quot;) is common as an equivalent for the
    subjunctive mode in clauses denoting a purpose, a wish, a hope, or a fear:<br>
    as, &quot;Bring him the book, that he <em>may read</em> to us;&quot; &quot;<em>May</em> he <em>rest</em> in
    peace;&quot; &quot;I hope you <em>may succeed</em>;&quot; &quot;They were afraid we <em>might lose</em> the
    way.&quot; &quot;Would&quot; and &quot;should&quot; are common substitutes for all tenses of the
    subjunctive: as, &quot;Walk carefully lest you (stumble) <em>should stumble</em>;&quot; &quot;If
    he (come) <em>should come</em>, he will find me at home;&quot; &quot;It (were) <em>would be</em>
    better if he (went) <em>should go</em> alone;&quot; &quot;If my sister had seen this mouse,
    she (had been) <em>would have been</em> frightened.&quot; In these sentences either
    the form in parenthesis or the italicized form is correct, though the
    latter is more common.</p>

  <p class="smallfont">NOTE.&mdash;It does not follow that the verbs &quot;may,&quot;
    &quot;would,&quot; and &quot;should&quot; always express the subjunctive idea.
    In the following sentences, for instance, they express the indicative idea:
    &quot;You <em>may</em> (<em>i.e</em>., are permitted to) stay an hour;&quot;
    &quot;You <em>should</em> (<em>i.e</em>., ought to) be punctual;&quot; &quot;Edith
    <em>would</em> not (<em>i.e</em>., was unwilling to) come.&quot; In such sentences
    &quot;may,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; and &quot;would&quot; make simple statements
    of fact.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Uses</strong> of the <strong>Subjunctive.</strong>&mdash;The indicative form is used in
    expressing a fact or what is assumed to be a fact: as &quot;He <em>thinks</em> he <em>is</em>
    ill;&quot; the subjunctive form indicates some <span id="pg085"></span>uncertainty or doubt in the
    speaker's mind: as, &quot;Whether it <em>rain</em> or not, I will go.&quot;</p>

  <p>The subjunctive idea occurs most frequently, perhaps, in <em>conditional
      sentences</em>. A conditional sentence is one that contains a condition or
    supposition. A supposition may refer to present, past, or future time. If
    it refers to present or past time, it may be viewed by the speaker as
    true, untrue, or as a mere supposition with nothing implied as to its
    truth; if it refers to the future, it may be viewed as either likely or
    unlikely. A supposition which is assumed to be true, or which is made
    without any hint as to its correctness, is expressed by the indicative. A
    supposition which is viewed by the speaker as untrue or unlikely is
    expressed by the subjunctive or a periphrase<span id="FNanchor87"></span><a href="#Footnote87">[87]</a> for the
    subjunctive. When
    the character of the supposition makes the conclusion untrue or unlikely,
    the conclusion also is expressed by the subjunctive or a periphrase<a href="#Footnote87">[87]</a> for
    the subjunctive. The use of tenses is peculiar, as will be seen from the
    following table of a few common forms of conditional sentences. The tenses
    should be carefully noted:&mdash;</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style='border-right:1px solid black; padding-right:10px; font-size:smaller;'>P<br>R<br>E<br>S<br>E<br>N<br>T</td>

        If it <em>rains</em> (<em>is raining</em>) now, I am sorry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Present indicative</em>: A simple supposition without any hint as to its correctness<br>
        If it <em>rained</em> (<em>were raining</em>), I <em>should be</em> sorry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Past subjunctive, both clauses</em>: The speaker implies that it is not raining.

      <td style='padding-left:10px'>
        If it <em>rained</em> (<em>was raining</em>), I was sorry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Past indicative</em>: No suggestion of doubt.<br>
        If it <em>had rained</em>, I <em>should have been</em> sorry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Past perfect subjunctive, both clauses</em>: The speaker implies that it did not rain.

      <td style='padding-left:10px'>
        If it <em>rains</em>, I shall be sorry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Present indicative</em>: The common, though inexact, form of a simple future supposition.<br>
        If it <em>rain</em>, I shall be sorry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Present subjunctive</em>: Less common, but more exact. The future is uncertain.<br>
        If it <em>should</em> (<em>were to</em>) <em>rain</em>, I <em>should be</em> sorry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Subjunctive, both clauses</em>: The uncertainty is emphasized by the auxiliary form; the chances of rain seem more remote.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p id="pg086"></p>
  <p class="smallfont">NOTE 1.&mdash;When <em>if</em> is equivalent to &quot;whenever&quot;, the condition is called
    &quot;general&quot;, to distinguish it from &quot;particular&quot; conditions, which refer to
    some particular act at some particular time. General conditions always
    take the indicative: as, &quot;If (whenever) it <em>rains</em>, I stay at home.&quot;</p>
  <p class="smallfont">NOTE 2.&mdash;Sometimes there is no &quot;if&quot;, and then
    the verb or a part of the
    verb precedes the subject: as, &quot;Were it raining, I should be sorry;&quot; &quot;Had
    it been raining, I should have been sorry.&quot;</p>
  <p class="smallfont">NOTE 3.&mdash;In such sentences as &quot;If thou hadst been
    here, my brother had not
    died,&quot; it may perhaps be questioned whether &quot;had not died&quot; is indicative,
    as in the Greek, or subjunctive, as in the Latin, idiom.</p>
  <p class="smallfont">NOTE 4.&mdash;Clauses introduced by <em>though</em> and <em>unless</em>
    take the same forms as clauses introduced by <em>if</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Wishes</em> are naturally expressed in the subjunctive. The <em>present</em>
    subjunctive denotes a wish for the future: as, &quot;Thy kingdom <em>come</em>.&quot;
    The <em>past</em> subjunctive denotes a wish for the present which is unfulfilled:
    as, &quot;I wish I <em>were</em> a bird.&quot; The <em>past perfect</em> subjunctive
    denotes a wish contrary to a past fact: as, &quot;I wish you <em>had been</em> there.&quot;</p>

  <p id="Footnote86"><a href="#FNanchor86">[86]</a> In such sentences the indicative would be, according to
    modern usage,<br>
    correct, and it is more common.<br>
    <span id="Footnote87"></span><a href="#FNanchor87">[87]</a> See paragraph 3, page 84. The forms in &quot;would&quot; and
    &quot;should&quot; in
    conditional sentences, though they express the subjunctive idea, can
    hardly be called the &quot;subjunctive mood&quot;. Sometimes they are called the
    &quot;conditional mood.&quot;

  <p><strong>Singular</strong> or <strong>Plural.</strong><span id="FNanchor88"></span><a
      href="#Footnote88">[88]</a>&mdash;The following principles, established by
    good usage, writers or speakers are liable to forget:&mdash;</p>
  <p>1. The expressions <em>each, every, many a, either</em>, and <em>neither</em> are singular.<br>
    2. When the subject consists of singular nouns or pronouns connected by
    <em>or, either</em>&mdash;<em>or</em>, or <em>neither</em>&mdash;<em>nor</em>, the verb must be singular.<br>
    3. Words joined to the subject by <em>with, together with, in addition to</em>,
    or <em>as well as</em>, are not a part of the grammatical subject, but are
    parenthetical, and therefore do not affect the number of the verb.<br>
    4. Since a relative pronoun has the number and person of its antecedent, a
    verb whose subject is a relative pronoun agrees in person and number with
    the antecedent of the relative.<br>
    5. &quot;When the subject though plural in form is singular in sense, the verb
    should be singular; when the subject though singular in form is plural in
    sense, the verb should be plural:&quot;<span id="FNanchor89"></span><a href="#Footnote89">[89]</a> as, &quot;'Gulliver's
    Travels' <em>was</em>
    written by Swift;&quot; &quot;Five hundred dollars <em>is</em> a large sum;&quot; &quot;Half of them
    <em>are</em> gone.&quot;<br>
    6. &quot;A collective noun, when it refers to the collection as a whole, is
    singular in sense, and therefore requires a singular verb; when it refers
    to the individual persons or things of the collection, it is plural and
    requires a plural verb.&quot;<span id="FNanchor90"></span><a href="#Footnote90">[90]</a>

  <p><strong>Accredit, credit.</strong>&mdash;'To <em>accredit</em> means 'to invest with credit or
    authority,'<span id="FNanchor91"></span><a href="#Footnote91">[91]</a> or 'to send with letters credential;' <em>to

  <p><strong>Arise, rise.</strong>&mdash;&quot;The choice between these words was primarily, and
    still often is, a matter of rhythm [euphony]. The literal meanings,
    however, or those which seem literal, have become more associated with
    <em>rise</em>, and the consciously figurative with <em>arise</em>: as, he <em>rose</em> from
    the chair; the sun <em>rose</em>; the provinces <em>rose</em> in revolt: trouble

  <p>II. A RESEMBLANCE IN SENSE MISLEADS.<span id="FNanchor94"></span><a href="#Footnote94">[94]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Antagonize, oppose</strong>.&mdash;To <em>antagonize</em> means properly &quot;to struggle
    against,&quot; &quot;to oppose actively,&quot; or &quot;to counteract.&quot; &quot;In England,
    antagonizing forces must be of the same kind, but in the political
    phraseology of the United States a person may antagonize (i.e., oppose) a
    measure.&quot;<span id="FNanchor95"></span><a href="#Footnote95">[95]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Calculate, intend</strong>.&mdash;To <em>calculate</em> means properly &quot;to compute
    mathematically,&quot; or &quot;to adjust or adapt&quot; for something. In the sense of
    <em>intend</em> it is not in good use.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Carry, bring, fetch</strong>.&mdash;To <em>carry</em> means &quot;to take along in going;&quot; to
    <em>bring</em> means &quot;to take along in coming;&quot; to <em>fetch</em> means &quot;to go, get, and
    bring.&quot;
  </p>
  <p><strong>Champion, support</strong>.&mdash;The word <em>champion</em> is very much overworked,
    being often used in the general sense of &quot;support.&quot; It should be
    restricted to cases in which there is the idea of entering the lists as
    champion of a cause.</p>
  <p><strong>Claim, assert, allege, maintain, declare, affirm, state</strong>.&mdash;To <em>claim</em>
    means properly &quot;to demand as one's own or one's due.&quot; It is often loosely
    used, especially in the United States, for &quot;assert,&quot; &quot;allege,&quot; &quot;maintain,&quot;
    &quot;declare,&quot; or &quot;affirm.&quot; To <em>assert</em> is &quot;to say or declare in the face of
    implied denial or doubt.&quot; To <em>allege</em> is &quot;to assert <span id="pg095"></span>without
    proof.&quot; To
    <em>maintain</em> is &quot;to uphold by argument.&quot; To <em>declare</em> is &quot;to say publicly,
    clearly, or emphatically.&quot; To <em>affirm</em> is &quot;to assert on one's reputation
    for knowledge or truthfulness.&quot; To <em>state</em>, which is also often misused in
    the sense of &quot;say,&quot; &quot;assert,&quot; &quot;allege,&quot; &quot;declare,&quot; or &quot;affirm,&quot;
    means
    properly &quot;to express formally and in detail;&quot; it always implies detail.
    (See &quot;Foundations,&quot; pp. 113, 114, and &quot;Practical Exercises,&quot; p. 99.)
  </p>
  <p><strong>Confess, admit.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Admit</em>, in cases into which the idea of confession
    does not enter, is preferable to <em>confess</em>. On grounds of idiom, however,
    'I must confess' and the parenthetical 'I confess' are exempt from the
    operation of this rule.&quot;<span id="FNanchor96"></span><a href="#Footnote96">[96]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Demand, ask.</strong>&mdash;<em>To demand</em> means &quot;<em>to ask</em> for with authority or with
    insistence.&quot; The use of &quot;demand&quot; in the sense of &quot;ask&quot; is borrowed,
    possibly, from the French use of <em>demander</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Hire, let, lease.</strong>&mdash;<em>To hire</em> means &quot;to obtain the use of;&quot; <em>to let</em>,
    &quot;to give the use of.&quot; <em>To lease</em> means &quot;to give the use of by lease.&quot; The
    owner of a house <em>leases</em> it; the person who occupies it <em>takes a lease</em>
    of it.</p>
  <p><strong>Learn, teach.</strong>&mdash;<em>Learn</em> means to &quot;acquire&quot; knowledge, not to
    &quot;impart&quot;
    it. In the latter sense the proper word is <em>teach</em>.</p>
  <p>&quot;I have more information to-day than I had before,&quot; said Mr. Sheehan.</p>
  <p>&quot;This has learned you something,&quot; said Mr. Goff.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; replied Mr. Sheehan, &quot;it has taught me something.&quot;<span id="FNanchor97"></span><a
      href="#Footnote97">[97]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Like, love.</strong>&mdash;<em>Like</em> and <em>love</em> differ greatly in strength or warmth,
    and may differ in kind. <em>Like</em> may be feeble and cool, and it never has
    the intensity of <em>love</em>. We may <em>like</em> or even <em>love</em> a person; we only
    <em>like</em> the most palatable kind of food. With an infinitive, <em>like</em> is the
    common word, <em>love</em> being appropriate only in the hyperbole of poetical or
    rhetorical feeling.<span id="FNanchor98"></span><a href="#Footnote98">[98]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Materialize, appear.</strong>&mdash;<em>To materialize</em> properly means &quot;to make or to
    become physically perceptible;&quot; as, &quot;by means of letters we materialize
    our ideas and make them as lasting as ink and paper;&quot; &quot;the ideas of the
    sculptor materialize in marble.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Plead, argue.</strong>&mdash;See <em>plea, argument,</em> p. 29.</p>
  <p><strong>Stay, stop.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Stay,</em> as in 'At what hotel are you staying?' is

    &quot;The locomotive <em>frightened</em> the horse;&quot; &quot;The horse <em>was frightened</em> by

    intransitively, as in the sentence &quot;The <em>horse frightened</em> at the
    locomotive.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Inquire, investigate.</strong>&mdash;To <em>inquire</em> is &quot;to ask for information;&quot; <em>to
      investigate</em> is &quot;to make a thorough examination.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Insure, secure.</strong>&mdash;<em>Secure</em>, in the sense of &quot;to guard from danger,&quot;
    &quot;to make safe,&quot; is preferable to <em>insure</em>, since <em>insure</em> also means &quot;to
    guarantee indemnity for future loss or damage.&quot;</p>

  <p><strong>Purpose, propose.</strong>&mdash;&quot;The verb <em>purpose</em>, in the sense of 'intend,' is
    preferable to <em>propose</em>, since <em>to propose</em> also means 'to offer for
    consideration:' the noun answering to the former is <em>purpose</em>; to the
    latter, <em>proposal</em> or <em>proposition</em>.&quot;<span id="FNanchor104"></span><a href="#Footnote104">[104]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Repulse, repel.</strong>&mdash;<em>Repulse</em> usually implies hostility; <em>repel</em> is a
    milder term. We <em>repulse</em> an enemy or an assailant; we <em>repel</em> an

    going,&quot; and is not followed by an infinitive. Before an infinitive,
    &quot;begin&quot; or &quot;commence&quot; is used. &quot;<em>Begin</em> is preferred in ordinary use;
    <span id="pg101"></span><em>commence</em> has more formal associations with law and procedure, combat,
    divine service, and ceremonial.&quot;<span id="FNanchor105"></span><a href="#Footnote105">[105]</a>

    surmise.&quot; <em>Expect</em>, in the sense of &quot;look forward to,&quot; is preferable to
    <em>anticipate</em>, since <em>anticipate</em> also means &quot;take up, perform, or realize
    beforehand;&quot; as, &quot;Some real lives do actually <em>anticipate</em> the happiness
    of heaven.&quot;

  <h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
  <h3>OF ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS</h3>

  <p><strong>An Adjective</strong> is a word joined by way of description or
    limitation to a noun or a pronoun.</p>
  <p><strong>An Adverb</strong> is a word joined by way of limitation or emphasis
    to a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.</p>
  <p><strong>Vulgarisms.</strong><span id="FNanchor110"></span><a href="#Footnote110">[110]</a>&mdash;Every educated person
    is expected to
    know the correct use of the following words:&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>Good, well.</strong>&mdash;<em>Good</em> is an adjective: the adverb corresponding to it
    is <em>well</em>. We say, &quot;He had a <em>good</em> sleep;&quot; &quot;He slept <em>well</em>.&quot;
    <em>Well</em> is sometimes an adjective, as in &quot;You look <em>well</em>.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Likely, probably, like.</strong>&mdash;<em>Likely</em> is now used as an adjective only,
    except in the phrase &quot;As <em>likely</em> as not;&quot; ad the corresponding adverb is
    <em>probably</em>. We say, &quot;He is <em>likely</em> to come;&quot; &quot;He will <em>probably</em> come.&quot;
    <em>Like</em> as an adjective means &quot;similar,&quot; as, &quot;Men of <em>like</em> excellence;&quot;
    &quot;He looks <em>like</em> his grandfather;&quot; &quot;He was a man of <em>like</em> passions as we
    are.&quot; In the sense of &quot;in the same manner as&quot; <em>like</em> is followed by a noun
    or a pronoun in the objective case, and is called by some an adverb, by
    others a preposition: as, &quot;He talks <em>like</em> her.&quot;
  </p>
  <p><strong>Less, fewer, smaller.</strong>&mdash;<em>Less</em> refers to quantity, <em>fewer</em> to number,
    <em>smaller</em> to size.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Most, almost.</strong>&mdash;<em>Most</em> denotes &quot;the greatest number, quantity, or
    degree.&quot; It is always superlative and never means &quot;nearly,&quot; which is the
    proper meaning of <em>almost</em>. We say, &quot;<em>Most</em> of the boys are here; the time
    has <em>almost</em> come.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Near, nearly.</strong>&mdash;<em>Near</em> is an adjective; the corresponding adverb is
    <em>nearly</em>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Plenty</strong> is now in good use as a noun only, as &quot;<em>Plenty</em> of corn and
    wine.&quot;<span id="FNanchor111"></span><a href="#Footnote111">[111]</a> Shakespeare used the word as an adjective in
    &quot;Reasons <span id="pg110"></span>as
    <em>plenty</em> as blackberries,&quot; but this use is obsolete. The use of <em>plenty</em>
    as an adverb, as &quot;The food is <em>plenty</em> good enough,&quot; is a vulgarism.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Some, somewhat, something.</strong>&mdash;<em>Some</em> is an adjective, as, &quot;<em>Some</em>
    water;&quot; &quot;<em>Some</em> brighter clime.&quot; <em>Somewhat</em> is an adverb, as, &quot;He is
    <em>somewhat</em> better.&quot; &quot;Somewhat&quot; is occasionally used as a noun, as,
    &quot;<em>Somewhat</em> of doubt remains,&quot; but in this sense <em>something</em> is more
    common.
  </p>
  <p><strong>This, these; that, those.</strong>&mdash;<em>This</em> (plural <em>these</em>) and <em>that</em> (plural
    <em>those</em>) are the only adjectives in English that have distinct forms for
    the plural. A common mistake is to use the plural forms with singular
    collective nouns, as &quot;kind,&quot; &quot;class,&quot; &quot;sort.&quot;
  </p>
  <p><strong>First, second, secondly,</strong> etc.&mdash;<em>First</em> is both adjective and adverb.
    <em>Second, third</em> etc., are adjectives only; the corresponding adverbs are
    <em>secondly, thirdly</em>, etc. <em>Firstly</em> is a vulgarism.
  </p>
  <p><em>Everywheres, illy, lesser, light-complected, muchly, nowhere near,
      unbeknown</em> are not in reputable use.</p>

  <p><strong>Adjective</strong> or <strong>Adverb.</strong><span id="FNanchor112"></span><a
      href="#Footnote112">[112]</a>&mdash;Illiterate persons often forget that
    adjectives go with nouns and pronouns, but adverbs with verbs, adjectives,
    and adverbs. Even cultivated persons are sometimes in doubt whether to use
    an adjective or an adverb after certain verbs, as &quot;grow,&quot; &quot;look,&quot; &quot;sound,&quot;
    &quot;smell,&quot; &quot;taste.&quot; If the added word applies to the subject of the verb, it
    should be an adjective; if to the verb, it should be an adverb. We say &quot;We
    feel <em>warm</em>&quot; when we mean that we are warm; we say &quot;We feel <em>warmly</em> on
    this subject,&quot; when we mean that our feeling is warm. &quot;As a rule, it is
    proper to use an adjective whenever some form of the verb 'to be' or 'to
    seem' may be substituted for the verb, an adverb when no such substitution
    can be made.&quot;<span id="FNanchor113"></span><a href="#Footnote113">[113]</a> Thus, &quot;He looked <em>angry</em>;
    he spoke <em>angrily</em>.&quot; Sometimes
    we may use either adjective or adverb with no difference in meaning: as,
    &quot;We were sitting <em>quiet</em> (<em>quietly</em>) round the fire.&quot;</p>
  <p>Regarding the <em>form</em> of adverbs, ill-taught pupils often suppose that all
    words ending in &quot;-ly&quot; are adverbs, and <span id="pg114"></span>that all adverbs end in
    &quot;-ly.&quot; A
    glance at the italicized words in the following expressions will remove
    this delusion: &quot;Come <em>here</em>;&quot; &quot;<em>very</em> pretty;&quot; &quot;he <em>then</em> rose;&quot;
    &quot;lay it
    <em>lengthwise</em>;&quot; &quot;he fell <em>backward</em>;&quot; &quot;run <em>fast</em>;&quot; &quot;<em>now</em>
    it is done;&quot; &quot;a
    <em>friendly</em> Indian;&quot; &quot;a buzzing <em>fly</em>.&quot; Though no comprehensive rule can be
    given for the form of adverbs, which must be learned for the most part by
    observation, it may be helpful to know that most &quot;adjectives of quality,&quot;
    like <em>gentle, true,</em> take the suffix &quot;-ly&quot; to make a corresponding adverb;
    and that the comparative and superlative degrees of adverbs ending in
    &quot;-ly&quot; usually prefix <em>more</em> and <em>most</em>.

  <p><strong>Misused Adjectives</strong> and <strong>Adverbs</strong>.<span id="FNanchor119"></span><a
      href="#Footnote119">[119]</a>&mdash;See the remarks under
    &quot;Misused Nouns.&quot; An amusing illustration of misused adjectives was
    furnished by an illiterate man who introduced his second wife to a friend
    as &quot;My <em>late</em> wife.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>I</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Aggravating, irritating.</strong>&mdash;In good use <em>aggravating</em> means &quot;making
    heavier, more grave, worse in some way.&quot; It is often misused for
    <em>irritating, exasperating,</em> or <em>provoking</em>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>All, the whole.</strong>&mdash;See page 120.</p>
  <p><strong>Apt, likely, liable.</strong>&mdash;<em>Apt</em> implies a natural predisposition, an
    habitual tendency. &quot;<em>Likely</em> implies a probability of whatever character;
    <em>liable</em>, an unpleasant probability.&quot;<span id="FNanchor120"></span><a href="#Footnote120">[120]</a> One is
    <em>apt</em> to speak quickly,
    <em>likely</em> to hear good news, <em>liable</em> to be hurt.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Both, each, every.</strong>&mdash;<em>Both</em>, meaning &quot;the two, and not merely one of
    them,&quot; groups objects, as, &quot;<em>Both</em> were men of hot temper.&quot; <em>Each</em> means
    &quot;all of any number, considered one by one,&quot; as, &quot;<em>Each</em> boy recited in his
    turn.&quot; <em>Every</em> means &quot;all of any number, considered as composing a group
    or class,&quot; as, &quot;<em>Every</em> pupil should have a dictionary and use it freely.&quot;
    &quot;<em>Every</em> directs attention chiefly to the totality, <em>each</em> chiefly to the
    individuals composing it. It may also be observed that <em>each</em> usually
    refers to a numerically definite group.... Thus, 'Each theory is open to
    objection' relates to an understood enumeration of theories, but 'Every
    theory is open to objection' refers to all theories that may exist.&quot;<span id="FNanchor121"></span><a
      href="#Footnote121">[121]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Many, much.</strong>&mdash;<em>Many</em> refers to number, <em>much</em> to quantity.</p>
  <p><strong>Mutual, common.</strong>&mdash;<em>Mutual</em> properly means &quot;reciprocal,&quot;
    &quot;interchanged.&quot; It is often misused for <em>common</em> in the sense of
    &quot;belonging equally to both or all,&quot; especially in the phrase, &quot;A <em>mutual</em>
    friend.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Partly, partially.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Partly</em>, in the sense of 'in part,' is preferable
    to <em>partially</em>, since <em>partially</em> also means 'with partiality.'&quot;<span id="FNanchor122"></span><a
      href="#Footnote122">[122]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Quite, very.</strong>&mdash;<em>Quite</em> properly means &quot;entirely&quot;; in the sense of
    &quot;very&quot; or &quot;to a considerable degree&quot; it is not in good use.</p>
  <p><strong>So-as, as-as.</strong>&mdash;Both <em>so</em> and <em>as</em> are used as adverbs of degree
    correlative with the conjunction &quot;as&quot;: unless there is a negative in the
    <span id="pg120"></span>clause <em>as</em> is generally used; with a negative <em>so</em> is preferable to
    <em>as</em>. We say &quot;It is <em>as</em> cold as ice,&quot; &quot;It is not <em>so</em> good as it looks.&quot;

  </p>
  <p><strong>II.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Apparently, evidently, manifestly.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Apparently</em> is properly used of
    that which seems, but may not be, real; <em>evidently</em>, of that which both
    seems and is real.&quot;<span id="FNanchor123"></span><a href="#Footnote123">[123]</a> <em>Manifestly</em> is stronger
    than <em>evidently</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Average, ordinary.</strong>&mdash;<em>Average</em> implies an arithmetical computation; if
    four persons lose respectively $10, $20, $30, and $40, the <em>average</em> loss
    is $25. The word is used figuratively by Dr. O.W. Holmes in &quot;The <em>average</em>
    intellect of five hundred persons, taken as they come, is not very high.&quot;
    In the sense of &quot;usual,&quot; &quot;common in occurrence,&quot; &quot;of the usual standard,&quot;
    <em>ordinary</em> is preferable to <em>average</em>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Bound, determined.</strong>&mdash;<em>Bound</em> properly means &quot;obliged,&quot; &quot;fated,&quot; or
    &quot;under necessity&quot;: as, &quot;A man is <em>bound</em> by his word;&quot; &quot;We hold ourselves
    in gratitude <em>bound</em> to receive ... all such persons.&quot; In the sense of
    &quot;determined&quot; <em>hound</em> is not in good use. In the sense of &quot;sure&quot; it is in
    colloquial, but not in literary, use.</p>
  <p><strong>Continual, continuous.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Continual</em> is used of frequently repeated
    acts, as, 'Continual dropping wears away a stone;' <em>continuous</em>, of
    uninterrupted action, as, 'the continuous flowing of a river.'&quot;[125]</p>
  <p><strong>Deadly, deathly.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Deathly</em>, in the sense of 'resembling death,' as,
    'She was deathly pale,' is preferable to <em>deadly</em>, since <em>deadly</em> also
    means 'inflicting death.'&quot;<span id="FNanchor124"></span><a href="#Footnote124">[124]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Decided, decisive.</strong>&mdash;&quot;A <em>decided</em> opinion is a strong opinion, which
    perhaps decides nothing; a <em>decisive</em> opinion settles the question at
    issue. A lawyer may have <em>decided</em> views on a case; the judgment of a
    court is <em>decisive</em>.&quot;<span id="FNanchor125"></span><a href="#Footnote125">[125]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Dumb, stupid.</strong>&mdash;<em>Dumb</em> properly means &quot;mute,&quot; &quot;silent.&quot; Its misuse
    for
    <em>stupid</em> is partly due, especially in Pennsylvania, to its resemblance to
    the German <em>dumm</em>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Existing, extant.</strong>&mdash;That is <em>extant</em> which has escaped the ravages of
    time (used chiefly of books, manuscripts, etc.); that is <em>existing</em> which has existence.</p>
  <p><strong>Funny, odd.</strong>&mdash;<em>Funny</em> means &quot;comical;&quot; in the sense of &quot;strange&quot; or
    &quot;odd&quot; it is not in good use.</p>
  <p><strong>Healthy, healthful, wholesome.</strong>&mdash;That is <em>healthy</em> which is in good
    <span id="pg123"></span>health; that is <em>healthful</em> or <em>wholesome</em> which produces health.
    <em>Wholesome</em> commonly applies to food.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Human, humane.</strong>&mdash;<em>Human</em> denotes what pertains to man as man;
    as, &quot;<em>human</em> nature,&quot; &quot;<em>human</em> sacrifices.&quot; <em>Humane</em> means
    &quot;compassionate.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Latest, last.</strong>&mdash;<em>Latest</em>, like the word &quot;late,&quot; contains a distinct
    reference to time; that is <em>latest</em> which comes after all others in time:<br>
    as, &quot;The <em>latest</em> news;&quot; &quot;The <em>latest</em> fashion.&quot; <em>Last</em>, which was
    originally a contraction of &quot;latest,&quot; is now used without any distinct
    reference to time, and denotes that which comes after all others in space
    or in a series: as, &quot;The <em>last</em> house on the street;&quot; &quot;The <em>Last</em> of the
    Mohicans.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Lengthy, long.</strong>&mdash;<em>Lengthy</em> is said to have originated in the United
    States, but the earliest quotations found are from British authors. In the
    introduction to the second series of The Biglow Papers, Mr. Lowell wrote:<br>
    &quot;We have given back to England the excellent adjective <em>lengthy</em> ... thus
    enabling their journalists to characterize our President's messages by a
    word civilly compromising between <em>long</em> and <em>tedious</em>, so as not to
    endanger the peace of the two countries by wounding our national
    sensitiveness to British criticism.&quot; <em>Lengthy</em> is used chiefly of
    discourses or writings, and implies tediousness. <em>Long</em> is used of
    anything that has length.</p>
  <p><strong>Mad, angry.</strong>&mdash;<em>Mad</em> means &quot;insane;&quot; in the sense of &quot;angry&quot; it is
    not in good use.</p>
  <p><strong>New, novel.</strong>&mdash;That is <em>new</em> which is not old; that is <em>novel</em> which is
    both new and strange.</p>
  <p><strong>Oral, verbal.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Oral</em>, in the sense of 'in spoken words,' is
    preferable to <em>verbal</em>, since <em>verbal</em> means 'in words' whether spoken or
    written.&quot;<span id="FNanchor126"></span><a href="#Footnote126">[126]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Pitiable, pitiful.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>Pitiable,</em> in the sense of 'deserving pity,' is
    preferable to <em>pitiful,</em> since <em>pitiful</em> also means 'compassionate,' as,
    'The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.'&quot;<a href="#Footnote126">[126]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Practicable, practical.</strong>&mdash;That is <em>practicable</em> which can be done;
    that is <em>practical</em> which is not theoretical only: as, &quot;a <em>practicable</em>
    plan,&quot; &quot;a <em>practical</em> electrician.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Prominent, eminent.</strong>&mdash;<em>Prominent</em> means &quot;conspicuous,&quot; &quot;standing out
    so as to be easily seen;&quot; <em>eminent</em> means &quot;distinguished in character or rank.&quot;</p>
  <p id="pg124"></p>
  <p><strong>Real, really, very.</strong>&mdash;<em>Real</em> is properly an adjective, meaning &quot;not
    imaginary or counterfeit,&quot; as, &quot;<em>real</em> diamonds.&quot; Its misuse for the
    adverbs <em>really</em> and <em>very</em>, as, &quot;This is <em>real</em> pretty,&quot; is a vulgarism.</p>
  <p><strong>Scared, afraid.</strong>&mdash;The participle <em>scared</em> means &quot;frightened;&quot; <em>afraid</em>
    is an adjective meaning &quot;in fear.&quot; Before &quot;of,&quot; the proper word is
    <em>afraid</em>: as, &quot;She is <em>afraid</em> of horses.&quot; <em>Scared of</em> is not in good use.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Grand, gorgeous, awful, splendid, elegant, lovely,
      magnificent.</strong>&mdash;<em>Grand</em> properly implies &quot;grandeur;&quot; <em>gorgeous</em>,
    &quot;splendid colors;&quot; <em>awful</em>, &quot;awe;&quot; <em>elegant</em>, &quot;elegance;&quot;
    <em>splendid</em>,
    &quot;splendor;&quot; <em>lovely,</em> &quot;surpassing loveliness;&quot; <em>magnificent</em>,
    &quot;magnificence.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;We talk, sometimes, with people whose conversation would lead you to
    suppose that they had lived in a museum, where all the objects were
    monsters and extremes.... They use the superlative of grammar: 'most
    perfect,' 'most exquisite,' 'most horrible.' Like the French, they are
    enchanted, they are desolate, because you have got or have not got a
    shoestring or a wafer you happen to want&mdash;not perceiving that superlatives
    are diminutives and weaken.... All this comes of poverty. We are unskilful
    definers. From want of skill to convey quality, we hope to move admiration
    by quantity. Language should aim to describe the fact.... 'Tis very
    wearisome, this straining talk, these experiences all exquisite, intense,
    and tremendous.&quot;<span id="FNanchor127"></span><a href="#Footnote127">[127]</a></p>

  <p><em>Illustrate by original sentences the correct use of each of these words:</em>

  <p><strong>Use</strong> of the <strong>Comparative and Superlative.</strong>&mdash;The comparative degree
    is preferable when two things or sets of things are compared, the
    superlative when three or more are compared.</p>
  <p>To say &quot;Iron is more useful than <em>any</em> metal&quot; is clearly incorrect,
    because iron is included in &quot;any metal,&quot; and of course iron is not more
    useful than itself. We must in thought set iron off in a class by itself,
    which we can do by inserting &quot;other&quot; after &quot;any.&quot; &quot;Iron is more useful
    than <em>any other</em> metal&quot; is correct. After comparatives accompanied by
    &quot;than,&quot; the words &quot;any&quot; and &quot;all&quot; should be followed by &quot;other.&quot;</p>
  <p>To say &quot;Iron is the most useful of <em>any</em> (or, <em>any other</em>) metal&quot; is also
    clearly incorrect, because we mean that iron is the most useful, not of
    &quot;one metal (no matter which)&quot; or of &quot;some metals (no matter which),&quot; but
    of all metals. We should therefore omit the word &quot;any,&quot; saying simply
    &quot;Iron is the most useful of (all) metals.&quot; It is also incorrect to say
    &quot;Iron is the most useful of all <em>other</em> metals,&quot; for iron is not one of
    the &quot;other metals.&quot; Beware of using &quot;any&quot; or &quot;other&quot; with superlatives

  <p><strong>Adverbs</strong> between <strong>To</strong> and <strong>The Infinitive</strong>.&mdash;&quot;A careful

    will do well to avoid the construction which places the adverb between

    not those who count most as authorities on questions of good usage.&quot;<span id="FNanchor131"></span><a

  <h3>OF PREPOSITIONS</h3>

  <p><strong>Misused Prepositions.</strong><span id="FNanchor132"></span><a href="#Footnote132">[132]</a>&mdash;A writer, in
    choosing the proper
    preposition to express his meaning, must rely chiefly on his sense of
    idiom, that is, his knowledge of English usage, but he may find the
    following notes helpful.</p>
  <p><strong>Among, between</strong>.&mdash;&quot;<em>Among</em> is the proper word when the reference is to
    more than two persons or things, or groups of persons or things;
    <em>between</em>, when the reference is to two only.&quot;<span id="FNanchor133"></span><a href="#Footnote133">[133]</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>At, in.</strong>&mdash;Before names of places to denote &quot;where,&quot; <em>at</em> is used when
    the place is so small as to be treated as a mere point, or when, although
    large, it is viewed as a mere point; <em>in</em> is used when it is desired to
    make prominent the idea &quot;within the bounds of:&quot; as, &quot;He arrived <em>at</em>
    Liverpool in the morning and remained <em>in</em> that city two days.&quot; Before the
    name of the place in which the speaker dwells, if the place is of any
    size, <em>in</em> is generally preferred to <em>at</em>, unless the place is so remote
    that it dwindles in the mental vision to a point.</p>
  <p><strong>Back of.</strong>&mdash;<em>Back of</em>, though frequently heard in conversation and
    sometimes seen in print, is not in good use.</p>
  <p><strong>Beside, besides.</strong>&mdash;<em>Beside</em> means &quot;by the side of;&quot; <em>besides</em> is now
    used only in the sense of &quot;in addition to,&quot; &quot;other than:&quot; as, &quot;Who sits
    <em>beside</em> you?&quot; &quot;Who <em>besides</em> us knows this?&quot;
  </p>
  <p><strong>By, with.</strong>&mdash;To introduce the agent of an action <em>by</em> is now commonly
    used; the material instrument or tool is usually introduced by <em>with</em>: as,
    &quot;Duncan was murdered <em>by</em> Macbeth <em>with</em> a dagger.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Different from, different to.</strong>&mdash;<em>Different from</em> is preferable to
    <em>different to</em> and <em>different than</em>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>In, into.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>In</em> implies presence inside of, or within; <em>into</em>
    implies movement to the inside of. Before a man can move <em>in</em> a room, he
    must already have moved <em>into</em> it.&quot;<span id="FNanchor134"></span><a href="#Footnote134">[134]</a></p>
  <p id="pg135"></p>
  <p><strong>In, on</strong>.&mdash;Before names of streets, <em>in</em> implies some reference to
    surroundings; <em>on</em> is less definite, indicating location only.</p>
  <p><strong>On to, onto</strong>.&mdash;&quot;Good use does not support either <em>on to</em> or
    <em>onto</em>.&quot;<span id="FNanchor135"></span><a href="#Footnote135">[135]</a>
  </p>

  <p><strong>Wait for, wait on</strong>.&mdash;<em>To wait for</em> means &quot;to await,&quot; as, &quot;We will
    <em>wait for</em> you at the corner.&quot; <em>To wait on</em> means &quot;to attend on,&quot; as, &quot;At
    dinner the women <em>waited on</em> the men.&quot;

  <h3>OF CONJUNCTIONS</h3>
  <p><strong>Vulgarisms.</strong><span id="FNanchor141"></span><a href="#Footnote141">[141]</a>&mdash;Every educated person
    is expected to know the correct
    use of the following words:&mdash;</p>

  <p><strong>Like, as.</strong>&mdash;In good use <em>like</em> is never a conjunction, and therefore
    it cannot be used instead of <em>as</em> to introduce a clause. It is incorrect
    to say, &quot;Walk <em>like</em> I walk,&quot; but one may say, &quot;He walks <em>like</em> me,&quot; or
    &quot;He looks <em>like</em> his grandfather.&quot;<span id="FNanchor142"></span><a href="#Footnote142">[142]</a></p>

  <p><strong>Except, without, unless.</strong>&mdash;<em>Except</em>, which was originally a
    past-participle, was once in good use as a conjunction; but in modern use
    it has been displaced as a conjunction by <em>unless</em>, and is now a
    preposition only. We may say, &quot;All went <em>except</em> me,&quot; but we may not say,
    &quot;<em>Except</em> you go with me, I will stay at home.&quot; Another word not in good
    use as a conjunction, but often heard instead of &quot;unless,&quot; is <em>without</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Misused Conjunctions.</strong><span id="FNanchor143"></span><a href="#Footnote143">[143]</a>&mdash;Conjunctions
    are few in number and are more
    definite in their meanings than prepositions. Most errors in using them
    spring from confused thinking or hasty writing. &quot;A close reasoner and a
    good writer in general may be known by his pertinent use of
    connectives.&quot;<span id="FNanchor144"></span><a href="#Footnote144">[144]</a></p>
  <p><strong>And.</strong>&mdash;<em>And</em> has, generally speaking, the meaning of &quot;in addition to.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>But</strong>.&mdash;<em>But</em> implies some exception, opposition, or contrast.
    Equivalent, or nearly equivalent, expressions are &quot;however,&quot; &quot;on the other
    hand,&quot; &quot;yet,&quot; &quot;nevertheless.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>As</strong>.&mdash;&quot;<em>As</em> has so many meanings that it is better, when possible, to
    use a conjunction that covers less ground.&quot;<span id="FNanchor145"></span><a href="#Footnote145">[145]</a></p>
  <p><strong>Because, for, since.</strong>&mdash;The difference between these words is chiefly a
    difference in emphasis. &quot;We will not go, <em>because</em> it is raining&quot; is the
    strongest way of expressing the relation of cause and effect. In &quot;<em>Since</em>
    it is raining, we will not go,&quot; the emphasis is shifted from <span id="pg144"></span>the cause to
    the effect, which becomes the prominent idea. In &quot;We will not go, <em>for</em> it
    is raining,&quot; the reason, &quot;it is raining,&quot; is announced as itself a bit of
    news. Often the choice between these words is decided by the ear.</p>
  <p><strong>How.</strong>&mdash;<em>How</em> properly means &quot;in what manner&quot; or &quot;to what extent.&quot;
    It is often misused for &quot;that&quot; to introduce an object clause.</p>
  <p><strong>Nor, or.</strong>&mdash;<em>Nor</em> is the correlative of <em>neither</em>, sometimes of other
    negatives. <em>Or</em> is the correlative of <em>either</em>.</p>
  <p><strong>Therefore, so.</strong>&mdash;In the sense of &quot;for this reason,&quot; <em>therefore</em> is
    preferable to <em>so</em>, since <em>so</em> has other meanings.</p>
  <p><strong>Though.</strong>&mdash;<em>Though</em> means &quot;notwithstanding,&quot; &quot;in spite of the fact
    that.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>As if, as though.</strong>&mdash;&quot;<em>As if</em> is, on the whole, preferable to <em>as<br>
      though.&quot;</em><span id="FNanchor146"></span><a href="#Footnote146">[146]</a></p>
  <p><strong>When, while.</strong>&mdash;<em>When</em> means &quot;at the time that;&quot; <em>while</em>, &quot;during
    the<br>
    time that,&quot; &quot;as long as.&quot; &quot;<em>When</em> fixes attention on a date or period;<br>
    <em>while</em> fixes attention on the lapse of time.&quot;<span id="FNanchor147"></span><a href="#Footnote147">[147]</a>

  </p>
  <p><strong>Omitted Conjunctions</strong>.&mdash;Careless writers sometimes omit conjunctions
    that are necessary either to the grammar or to the sense. A common form of
    this fault is illustrated in &quot;This is as good if not better than that&quot;&mdash;a
    sentence in which &quot;as&quot; is omitted after &quot;as good.&quot; The best way to correct
    the sentence is to recast it, thus: &quot;This is as good as that, if not
    better.&quot;</p>

  <p><strong>EXERCISE LXXXVIII.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Correct the faults in these sentences:</em>&mdash;</p>
  <p>1. Ralph is as young or younger than Harry.<br>
    2. Cedar is more durable but not so hard as oak.<br>
    3. I never heard any one speak more fluently or so wittily as he.<br>
    4. She is fairer but not so amiable as her sister.<br>
    5. Though not so old, he is wiser than his brother.</p>
  <p><strong>Redundant Conjunctions.</strong>&mdash;<span id="FNanchor148"></span><a href="#Footnote148">[148]</a> Careless
    writers sometimes insert
    conjunctions that are useless or worse than useless.
    <span id="pg147"></span>A common form of this fault is the use in certain cases of &quot;and&quot; or
    &quot;but&quot;
    before the words &quot;who,&quot; &quot;which,&quot; &quot;when,&quot; or &quot;where,&quot; which are themselves
    connectives: as, &quot;The challenge was accepted by Orlando, a young man
    little known up to that time, <em>but</em> to <em>whom</em> Rosalind had taken a great
    liking.&quot; If the relative clause introduced by &quot;who,&quot; &quot;which,&quot; &quot;when,&quot; or
    &quot;where&quot; is to be joined to a preceding relative clause, the conjunction is
    proper: as, &quot;The challenge was accepted by Orlando, a young man <em>who</em> was
    little known at that time, <em>but</em> to whom Rosalind had taken a great
    liking.&quot;

  <p><strong>EXERCISE LXXXIX.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Which conjunctions in these sentences are redundant</em>?&mdash;</p>
  <p>
    1. I have again been so fortunate as to obtain the assistance of Dr.
    Jones, a teacher of great experience, and whose ideas are quite in harmony
    with my own.<br>
    2. Franklin had noticed for some time the extreme dirtiness of the
    streets, and especially of the street that he lived on.<br>
    3. This animal was considered as irresistible.<br>
    4. But how to get him there was a problem. But it was decided to convey
    him on one of the wagons used in carrying the Emperor's men-of-war from
    the woods, where they were made, to the water.<br>
    5. He forgot to pay for the wine&mdash;a shortness of memory common with such
    men, and which his host did not presume to correct.<br>
    6. Next came Louis, Duke of Orleans, the first prince of the blood royal,
    and to whom the attendants rendered homage as the future king.<br>
    7. So from all this you can see that such things are not impossible.<br>
    8. Her expression of countenance induced most persons to address her with
    a deference inconsistent with her station, and which nevertheless she
    received with easy composure.<br>
    9. Our escort consisted of MacGregor, and five or six of the handsomest,
    best armed, and most athletic mountaineers of his band, and whom he had
    generally in immediate attendance upon his own person.<br>
    <span id="pg148"></span>10. The little town of Lambtos, Mrs. Gardiner's former home, and where
    she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained.<br>
    11. He spoke in a deep and low tone, but which nevertheless was heard from
    one end of the hall to the other.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Misplaced Correlatives.</strong>&mdash;When conjunctions are used as correlatives,
    as &quot;both-and,&quot; &quot;either-or,&quot; each of the correlated words should be so
    placed as to indicate clearly what ideas are to be connected in thought.
    This principle is violated in &quot;He <em>not only</em> visited Paris, <em>but</em> Berlin
    <em>also.</em>&quot; In this sentence the position of &quot;not only&quot; before the verb
    &quot;visited&quot; leads one to expect some corresponding verb in the second part
    of the sentence; in fact, however, the two connected words are &quot;Paris&quot; and
    &quot;Berlin;&quot; &quot;visited&quot; applies to both. This meaning is clearly indicated by
    putting &quot;not only&quot; before &quot;Paris:&quot; thus, &quot;He visited <em>not only</em> Paris,
    <em>but</em> Berlin <em>also</em>.&quot; As a rule the word after the first correlative
    should be the same part of speech as the word after the second
    correlative.
  </p>

  <p><strong>EXERCISE XC.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Correct the errors of position in</em>&mdash;</p>
  <p>1. Few complaints were made either by the men or the women.<br>
    2. Search-lights are not useful only on ships, but also on land.<br>
    3. Adversity both teaches to think and to be patient.<br>
    4. My uncle gave me not only the boat, but also taught me to row it.<br>
    5. The prisoner was not only accused of robbery, but of treason.<br>
    6. The wise ruler does not aim at the punishment of offenders, but at the prevention of offences.<br>
    7. The king was weak both in body and mind.<br>
    8. He either is stupid or insolent.<br>
    9. He worked not to provide for the future, but the present.<br>
    10. Every composition is liable to criticism both in regard to its design and to its execution.<br>
    11. The gods are either angry or nature is too powerful.<br>
    <span id="pg149"></span>12. We are neither acquainted with the Doctor nor with his family.<br>
    13. In estimating the work of Luther, we must neither forget the temper of
    the man nor the age in which he lived.<br>
    14. The wise teacher should not aim to repress, but to encourage his pupils.<br>
    15. Such rules are useless both for teachers and pupils.<br>
    16. Her success is neither the result of cleverness nor of studiousness.

  <h2>APPENDIX</h2>
  <h3>SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h3>

  <p>The following suggestions are made in answer to many inquiries from
    teachers who perceive the rare excellence of the &quot;Foundations of
    Rhetoric,&quot; but who do not clearly see, because of the novel method of the
    book, how to turn its merits to account in their class-rooms. The
    suggestions outline one way in which the book has been used to great
    advantage.</p>

  <p>It should never be forgotten that the illustrative sentences in the
    &quot;Foundations&quot; have no value except as they help the student to grasp a
    principle that he can apply in his own use of language. In every case the
    emphasis should be laid on the principle which is announced or
    illustrated. Merely learning the corrected sentences by heart is useless
    and should not be permitted.</p>

  <p>In taking a class over PART I., which treats of words, it is the writer's
    practice to assign a short lesson&mdash;from one to three pages&mdash;in connection
    with every recitation in English. The leading ideas and most typical
    sentences in each lesson are privately marked in the teacher's book with
    colored pencil, so that they may readily catch his eye, and from five to
    twelve minutes of each recitation period are taken up with a rapid
    questioning on these leading ideas and typical sentences. Corrections or
    answers unaccompanied by reasons are not accepted. Attention is always
    fixed, not on the form of the illustrative sentence, but on the principle
    of usage under discussion. Pupils would rather commit to memory the
    <span id="pg152"></span>sentences than trouble themselves about reasons; but they will master
    reasons when they find they must. After principles have been mastered,
    exercises in the choice of forms and words are needed in order that
    knowledge may be converted into habit.
  </p>

  <p>In PARTS II. and III. the lessons are equally short and the emphasis is
    unceasingly laid on the question &quot;Why?&quot; If the subject is difficult, it is
    desirable, at the time that the lesson is assigned, to lead the class over
    the text and some of the illustrative sentences in order to open, as it
    were, the eyes of the pupils. Since these parts of the book treat not of
    single words, but of sentences and paragraphs, recitations on them seem to
    call for the use of pencil or chalk. One successful teacher conducts the
    recitation with books open, requiring her pupils to cover the correct
    sentences with a strip of paper while they explain and correct the faults
    in the incorrect sentences. The writer's practice is to paste the faulty
    sentences on cards of convenient size and thickness&mdash;the arrangement of
    columns is such that the sentences can all be cut from <em>one</em> old book&mdash;and
    to distribute them among eight or ten pupils at the beginning of the
    recitation hour. While other matters are being attended to, these pupils
    write the sentences in correct form on the blackboard, and, when the time
    comes, give their reasons for the changes which they have made. Their work
    is discussed, if necessary, by the whole class. Reviews and written tests
    should be frequent. As fast as the various principles explained and
    illustrated in PARTS II. and III. are studied, the attention of pupils
    should be immediately turned to their own writing. It will be far more
    profitable for them to correct their own offences against clearness,
    force, ease, and unity than to correct similar offences committed by
    others. For this reason the PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ENGLISH contains no
    exercises on the subjects discussed in PARTS II. and III. of the
    &quot;Foundations.&quot;</p>
